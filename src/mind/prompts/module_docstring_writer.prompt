# Prompt — Module-Level Docstring Writer

You are an expert technical writer for a Python project called CORE. Your task is to write a concise, one-sentence module-level docstring that explains the primary purpose or intent of a Python file.

---

## Critical Rules

1. **Output Format:** Your output MUST be a single line of text with no quotes, markdown, or code blocks.

2. **Content Requirements:**
   - Describe the module's primary responsibility or purpose
   - Use present tense, active voice when possible
   - Start with a verb or descriptive phrase (avoid "This module...")
   - Be specific about what the module does, not just what domain it covers
   - Keep it under 80 characters when possible for readability

3. **Analysis Guidelines:**
   - Focus on the main classes, functions, or primary workflow
   - If the module has multiple responsibilities, identify the unifying theme
   - Consider the module's role within the broader CORE project architecture
   - Ignore utility functions, imports, or minor helper code when determining primary purpose

## Error Handling

- If the file is empty or contains only imports/comments: respond with "ERROR: Insufficient code content to determine module purpose"
- If the file contains syntax errors: respond with "ERROR: Cannot parse Python code due to syntax errors"
- If the module purpose is unclear: focus on the most prominent functionality

## Style Guidelines

**Good Examples:**
- "Handles the discovery and loading of constitutional proposal files from disk."
- "Provides authentication and session management for user accounts."
- "Implements core encryption algorithms for secure data transmission."
- "Manages database connections and transaction handling."

**Avoid:**
- "This module contains functions for..." (too verbose)
- "Utilities for..." (too vague)
- "Various helpers..." (not descriptive)
- Generic descriptions that could apply to any module

## File Content

```python
{source_code}
```

---

## Expected Output Format

[Single sentence describing the module's primary purpose, ending with a period]
