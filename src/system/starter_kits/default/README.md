# Welcome to Your New CORE Constitution

This `.intent/` directory is the "Mind" of your new application. It contains the complete, machine-readable definition of your project's goals, rules, and structure. It is the single source of truth that governs the behavior of any AI agents working on this codebase.

This starter kit was generated by CORE to provide a balanced, best-practice foundation for your project.

## Your First Steps

1.  **Review `mission/principles.yaml`**: These are the high-level values of your project. You should edit them to match your own philosophy.
2.  **Review `project_manifest.yaml`**: This file lists the capabilities your application is expected to have. As you add `# CAPABILITY:` tags to your code, this list should grow.
3.  **Run Your First Audit**: Use CORE's tools to run a constitutional audit. This will tell you if your code is in alignment with the rules defined here.

This constitution is now yours. Evolve it, amend it, and use it to guide your project's growth with clarity and purpose.
