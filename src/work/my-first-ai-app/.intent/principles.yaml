# .intent/mission/principles.yaml
principles:
  - id: clarity_first
    description: >
      Every function must have a docstring explaining its purpose.
      If a human cannot understand a piece of code in 30 seconds, it must be simplified.
  - id: safe_by_default
    description: >
      Every change must assume rollback or rejection unless explicitly validated.
      No file write or code execution may proceed without confirmation or a safety check.
  - id: no_orphaned_logic
    description: >
      All code must be discoverable and auditable. No function or file should exist
      without being traceable to a manifest or a clear purpose.
  - id: single_source_of_truth
    description: >
      The `.intent/` directory is the single source of truth for the project's
      capabilities, structure, and intent. All governance is derived from these files.
