## [03/08/2025 - Cleanup & Refactoring Completed]

### Removed
- `fix_function_manifest.py` (superseded by `function_manifest_updater.py`)
- `fix_manifest_format_again.py` (obsolete due to manifest stabilization)
- Standalone manifest validator: `src/core/manifest_validator.py` (redundant after consolidation)

### Consolidated & Improved
- Centralized schema validation explicitly integrated into comprehensive integrity checker: `validate_intent_structure.py`.
- Preserved all original detailed validation logic, semantic checks, immutability enforcement, and structured reporting.

### Notes
- All removal and consolidation actions explicitly confirmed, reviewed, and verified.
