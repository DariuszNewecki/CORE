## What is CORE?

**CORE is a self-governing AI development framework that builds and evolves software in constant alignment with a machine-readable constitution.**

It solves the problem of architectural drift and ensures that every change, whether made by a human or an AI, is deliberate, safe, and traceable to a declared purpose.
