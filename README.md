# CORE ‚Äî Architectural Integrity for AI-Era Development

CORE ensures your code stays true to your project‚Äôs design, using AI to catch architectural violations and guide safe, governed development.

---

## Why CORE?

Codebases often drift from their intended design:

* New features ignore established patterns.
* Modules import dependencies they shouldn‚Äôt.
* Documentation becomes outdated.
* Reviews miss big-picture issues.

Linters catch syntax errors, but architectural mistakes slip through.
**CORE** uses a **‚Äúconstitution‚Äù** (rules in `.intent/`) and **AI-powered auditing** to keep your project on track.

---

## CORE in 30 Seconds

1. **Set Rules**: Define your project‚Äôs architecture in `.intent/` (e.g., which modules can talk to each other).
2. **Write Code**: Build your app as usual in `src/`.
3. **Audit**: Run `make audit` to check if code follows rules.
4. **Fix**: Get clear feedback with fixes (e.g., *‚ÄúMove this import to a service layer‚Äù*).

### Example Audit Output

```
‚ùå Violation: src/api/user.py
Issue: 'api' imported 'database.models'
Rule: API layer only imports 'services'
Fix: Use UserService for database logic
```

## Try It Out (5-Minute Demo)

See CORE in action with the worked example:

1. Create a **‚ÄúQuote of the Day‚Äù API**.
2. Break a rule (e.g., add a forbidden import).
3. Watch CORE catch it and suggest a fix.

## Visualizing CORE

CORE‚Äôs **Mind‚ÄìBody‚ÄìWill** model ensures governance:

```
+-----------------+
| Mind (.intent/) | Rules & Principles (YAML/JSON)
+-----------------+
        |
        v
+-----------------+
| Will (AI Agents)| Plans & Generates Code
+-----------------+
        |
        v
+-----------------+
| Body (src/)     | Your Codebase
+-----------------+
        |
        v
[Auditor] Ensures code aligns with rules
```

## Project Status & Independent Review

CORE is an **Architectural Prototype (v0.2.0)**, with a stable and functional governance loop. It has been independently reviewed by multiple AI assessors (Grok, ChatGPT) with a strong consensus:

* **Overall Score:** \~7.9 / 10
* **Key Strengths:** Governance & Safety (9/10), Documentation (8.5/10)
* **Next Steps:** Focus is on enhancing the AI reasoning layer and feature completeness.

The reviews confirm that CORE's foundation is exceptionally strong. The full reviews are archived in `docs/reviews/`.
