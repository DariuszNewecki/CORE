# CORE
The last developer you’ll ever need.

# In one-sentence
An AI-native operating core that hears a human problem, negotiates an intent bundle, and autonomously designs, builds, tests, deploys, and continuously rewrites complete applications—while enforcing constitutional governance to prevent drift.

# What CORE does
Conversational onboarding → turns raw problem statements into machine-enforceable YAML intent bundles
Dual-intent governance
Business intent (human-readable)
Architectural intent (machine-readable)
Capsule factory → python -m core capsule new <name> scaffolds both bundles in seconds
Self-replication → auto-regenerates its own source code (src/) to stay aligned with both bundles
Zero human commits → CI gate rejects any .py file not produced by CORE
