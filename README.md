## What is CORE?

**CORE is a self-governing AI development framework that builds and evolves software in constant alignment with a machine-readable constitution.**

It solves the problem of architectural drift and ensures that every change, whether made by a human or an AI, is deliberate, safe, and traceable to a declared purpose.

**[➡️ Start here to understand the project: `docs/00_WHAT_IS_CORE.md`](docs/00_WHAT_IS_CORE.md)**

## How is CORE Different?

CORE is not a code generator like Copilot or an unconstrained agent like AutoGPT. It is an **AI System Architect** designed for governance and long-term maintainability.

**[➡️ See a full comparison: `docs/08_CONTEXT_AND_COMPARISONS.md`](docs/08_CONTEXT_AND_COMPARISONS.md)**

## Project Status & Roadmap

We have recently completed a major architectural refactor to the **Mind/Body/Will** model. Our current work is focused on hardening this foundation and expanding the system's autonomous capabilities.
