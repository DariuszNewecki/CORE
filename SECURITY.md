## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take all security vulnerabilities seriously. Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

Instead, please report them by using GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature. Go to the "Security" tab of the repository and click "Report a vulnerability".

You should receive an acknowledgment within **3 business days**.

## Disclosure Process

We follow a coordinated disclosure process. Once a vulnerability is reported, we will work to release a patch as quickly as possible. We will publish a security advisory on GitHub to notify users upon release.
