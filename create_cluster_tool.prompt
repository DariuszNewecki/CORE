Your goal is to create a new, deterministic CLI command that finds clusters of semantically similar code.

**Part 1: Create the Graph Analysis Service**
In a new file at `src/features/introspection/graph_analysis_service.py`, create a new async function named `find_semantic_clusters`.
This function should:
1. Accept an optional similarity threshold (default 0.85).
2. Connect to the Qdrant service.
3. Scroll through all vectors in the collection.
4. Use the `networkx` library to build a graph where each symbol is a node and an edge exists between two nodes if their cosine similarity is above the threshold.
5. Use `networkx.connected_components` to find all subgraphs (clusters) of similar functions.
6. Return a list of lists, where each inner list contains the symbol keys of a cluster.

**Part 2: Create the New CLI Command**
In `src/cli/commands/diagnostics.py`, create a new async Typer command named `find-clusters`.
This command should:
1. Call the `find_semantic_clusters` function from the new service.
2. Find the largest cluster from the results.
3. Print a rich-formatted table to the console listing all the members of the largest cluster.

Ensure you add all necessary imports, including `networkx`, and update the `register` function to expose the new command.
