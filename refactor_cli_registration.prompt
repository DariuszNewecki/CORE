You are an expert software architect specializing in the CORE system, tasked with performing a refactoring based on a data-driven analysis.

**Goal:**
Refactor the CLI command registration process to eliminate duplication and adhere to the `dry_by_design` principle.

**Evidence (From `check diagnostics find-clusters`):**
A recent semantic cluster analysis has identified that the `register` functions in nearly all files within `src/cli/commands/` are semantically identical. They form a large cluster (Cluster #6) of duplicated boilerplate code. This refactoring is intended to resolve that finding.

**Architectural Requirements:**
1.  **Create a central helper:** In `src/cli/admin_cli.py`, create a new helper function or a more pythonic solution (like a list of modules to be registered) that can be used to register all command groups declaratively.
2.  **Refactor all command modules:** Modify every command module file in `src/cli/commands/` to use this new, simplified registration mechanism. The individual `register` functions in those files should be removed.
3.  **Preserve Functionality:** The final `core-admin --help` output must be identical to the original, proving that all commands are still correctly registered.
