# .pre-commit-config.yaml
#
# Defines the pre-commit hooks that are run automatically before each commit.
# This enforces the 'clarity_first' and 'safe_by_default' principles by
# ensuring all committed code is formatted and linted to project standards.
#
# To install the hooks, run: `pre-commit install`
