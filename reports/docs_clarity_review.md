# Human Clarity Audit for CORE Documentation

## 1. The "Stijn Test": What Does It Do?

**CORE is an AI-powered governance framework that enforces architectural rules in codebases.** It uses a machine-readable "constitution" to automatically detect when code violates design patterns (like forbidden imports) and suggests fixes to maintain architectural integrity.

## 2. Overall Clarity Score (1-10): **7/10**

**Justification:** The documentation is generally well-structured with excellent conceptual explanations but suffers from some organizational and terminology issues.

**Positive Examples:**
- The README's "CORE in 30 Seconds" section provides an excellent quick overview
- The "Why CORE?" section clearly articulates the problem space
- The Mind-Body-Will analogy throughout the docs is conceptually strong
- The worked example (09_WORKED_EXAMPLE.md) provides concrete, actionable demonstration

**Negative Examples:**
- Multiple documents repeat the same core concepts without clear progression
- Some advanced terminology appears before basic explanations (e.g., "constitutional changes" in CONTRIBUTING.md before the concept is fully explained)
- The documentation portal in README.md lists files that don't exist in the provided bundle (e.g., docs/01_PHILOSOPHY.md appears to be docs/01_PHILOSOPHY.md)

## 3. Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Create a single, clear entry point for conceptual understanding**
   - **Confusing Text:** Multiple documents (README.md, docs/00_WHAT_IS_CORE.md, docs/01_PHILOSOPHY.md) all attempt to explain "what CORE is" with overlapping content.
   - **Why Confusing:** A new user doesn't know where to start. The README should be the definitive starting point, with other documents providing depth on specific aspects.

2. **Standardize and simplify initial terminology**
   - **Confusing Text:** "Constitutional change" appears in CONTRIBUTING.md before the concept of the constitution is fully explained to a new user.
   - **Why Confusing:** Throwing advanced governance terminology at someone who's just learning what CORE is creates cognitive load. Basic concepts should be established before introducing governance mechanics.

3. **Fix documentation references and ensure all linked documents exist**
   - **Confusing Text:** README.md lists "Philosophy (docs/01_PHILOSOPHY.md)" but the provided file is named "docs/01_PHILOSOPHY.md" (note the 'H' vs 'S' difference).
   - **Why Confusing:** Broken or incorrect references undermine credibility and create frustration when users can't find the promised information.

4. **Provide clearer differentiation from similar tools earlier**
   - **Confusing Text:** The comparison to other tools (Copilot, AutoGPT) is buried in docs/08_CONTEXT_AND_COMPARISONS.md, which many users might not reach.
   - **Why Confusing:** Developers need to quickly understand how this differs from tools they already know. This positioning should appear much earlier in the documentation journey.

## 4. Conceptual Gaps

1. **Integration Story:** How does CORE integrate with existing development workflows? Does it replace my linters/CI, or complement them?
2. **Performance Impact:** What's the runtime cost of the auditing process? How does it scale with large codebases?
3. **Adoption Path:** If I have an existing project, what's the effort to "CORE-fy" it? The BYOR documentation explains the mechanism but not the practical effort.
4. **LLM Requirements:** What specific AI services are required? The documentation mentions "LLM API keys" but doesn't specify which providers/models are supported or required.
5. **Error Handling:** What happens when the auditor fails? Are there false positives? How are conflicts between AI suggestions and human intent resolved?
6. **Team Collaboration:** How do multiple developers work with CORE simultaneously? Are there merge conflict considerations for the .intent/ directory?
7. **Customization Limits:** How flexible are the rules? Can I create completely custom architectural patterns, or am I limited to predefined rule types?
