# CORE Human Clarity Audit

## 1. The "Stijn Test": What Does It Do?

**CORE is a self-governing AI development framework that builds and evolves software according to a machine-readable constitution, preventing architectural drift and ensuring all changes are deliberate, safe, and traceable to declared purposes.**

The documentation clearly passes this primary test - multiple documents (README.md, 00_WHAT_IS_CORE.md) provide this concise explanation.

## 2. Overall Clarity Score (7/10)

The documentation is well-structured with thoughtful philosophical grounding, but suffers from some organizational and conceptual repetition that could confuse new readers.

**Strengths:**
- Excellent high-level explanations in `00_WHAT_IS_CORE.md` and `01_PHILOSOPHY.md`
- Clear separation of concerns with the Mind/Body/Will architecture
- Practical guides like `05_BYOR.md` and `07_PEER_REVIEW.md` provide concrete use cases
- The governance model in `03_GOVERNANCE.md` is particularly well-explained

**Weaknesses:**
- Multiple README files with overlapping content create confusion
- Key concepts are explained multiple times with slightly different wording
- The relationship between different documents isn't always clear
- Some architectural details feel prematurely exposed to new readers

## 3. Suggestions for Improvement

**1. Consolidate and streamline the entry points**
> *Confusing text:* Multiple README files (`./README.md`, `./docs/06_STARTER_KITS.md` contains another README section) with overlapping content.
> *Why confusing:* A new user doesn't know which document to read first. The main README should be the single, authoritative starting point that clearly directs to other documents without duplication.

**2. Clarify the relationship between philosophical and practical documents**
> *Confusing text:* `TheDocument.md` states "This document defines the philosophy and operating principles" while `01_PHILOSOPHY.md` also covers similar ground with "The CORE Philosophy."
> *Why confusing:* The purpose distinction between these documents isn't clear. A new reader wonders if they need to read both, and if so, in what order.

**3. Provide clearer sequencing guidance**
> *Confusing text:* Various documents reference each other (e.g., "Now that you understand the why, you're ready for the how" in `00_WHAT_IS_CORE.md`) but no clear reading order is prescribed.
> *Why confusing:* A busy developer needs explicit guidance on what to read first, second, third. The current structure assumes they'll naturally find the optimal path.

**4. Simplify architectural terminology upfront**
> *Confusing text:* Early documents introduce "Mind/Body/Will" while later documents use "Architectural Trinity" and "Mind-Body Problem, Solved" with slightly different emphasis.
> *Why confusing:* The subtle differences in terminology between documents create cognitive load without adding clarity. Consistent terminology would be easier to follow.

## 4. Conceptual Gaps

**1. Concrete use cases and examples:** While the philosophy is well-explained, the documentation lacks specific examples of what CORE actually produces. What does a "governed application" look like in practice?

**2. Comparison to alternatives:** How does CORE differ from other AI-assisted development tools (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, etc.) or existing governance frameworks? This context would help developers understand where CORE fits in the ecosystem.

**3. Target audience specificity:** While `00_WHAT_IS_CORE.md` mentions "who this is for," it could be more specific about the types of projects and teams that would benefit most from CORE's approach.

**4. Current capabilities vs. future vision:** The documentation sometimes blurs the line between what CORE can do today (as an "Architectural Prototype") and its aspirational North Star goals. A clearer distinction would manage expectations.

**5. Integration story:** How does CORE work with existing development workflows, CI/CD pipelines, and team structures? The documentation assumes adoption of CORE's entire paradigm but doesn't address incremental adoption.
