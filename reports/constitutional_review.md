Here's my critical peer review of the CORE constitutional bundle:

**1. Overall Assessment:**

Strengths:
- Excellent clarity and organization of governance documents
- Strong coverage of core principles (safety, clarity, evolvability)
- Comprehensive runtime requirements and configuration management
- Well-defined agent roles and capability taxonomy
- Robust change control processes for constitutional amendments

Weaknesses:
- Some policy files are marked as "not yet implemented"
- Limited documentation on error handling and recovery procedures
- Some redundancy between policy files that could be consolidated
- Missing explicit data privacy and retention policies
- Could benefit from more examples in documentation

**2. Specific Suggestions for Improvement:**

1. **File:** `.intent/policies/dependency_management.yaml`
   - **Justification:** Serves `clarity_first` and `completeness` by providing concrete rules for dependency management rather than being empty.
   - **Proposed Change:**
```diff
- rules: []
+ rules:
+   - id: license_compatibility
+     description: All dependencies must have OSI-approved licenses compatible with our MIT license
+     enforcement: hard
+   - id: vulnerability_scanning
+     description: All dependencies must be scanned for known vulnerabilities before addition
+     enforcement: hard
+   - id: pinned_versions
+     description: Production dependencies must have exact version pins
+     enforcement: hard
```

2. **File:** `.intent/policies/incident_response.yaml`
   - **Justification:** Serves `safe_by_default` by defining concrete incident response procedures rather than being empty.
   - **Proposed Change:**
```diff
- procedures: []
+ procedures:
+   - id: containment
+     steps:
+       - Isolate affected components
+       - Freeze all change proposals
+       - Enable local_fallback mode
+   - id: analysis
+     steps:
+       - Create forensic copy of .intent/ and change logs
+       - Trace actions through audit logs
+   - id: remediation
+     steps:
+       - Constitutional amendment to address root cause
+       - Rotate all cryptographic keys if compromised
```

3. **File:** `.intent/constitution/approvers.yaml`
   - **Justification:** Serves `evolvable_structure` by making quorum requirements more flexible for different stages of development.
   - **Proposed Change:**
```diff
 quorum:
-  # Regular amendments require 1 signature
-  standard: 1
-  # Critical changes require 1 signature while under solo development.
-  critical: 1
+  development:
+    standard: 1
+    critical: 1
+  production:
+    standard: 2
+    critical: 3
+  current_mode: development
```

4. **File:** `.intent/policies/safety_policies.yaml`
   - **Justification:** Serves `predictable_side_effects` by adding explicit network security controls.
   - **Proposed Change:**
```diff
+  # ===================================================================
+  # RULE: Restrict network access
+  # ===================================================================
+  - id: restrict_network_access
+    description: >
+      Only explicitly allowed domains may be contacted. All outbound network
+      calls must be through approved integration points.
+    enforcement: hard
+    allowed_domains:
+      - "api.openai.com"
+      - "github.com"
+    action: reject
+    feedback: |
+      ‚ùå Attempt to contact unauthorized domain: {{domain}}. Update safety_policies.yaml to allow if needed.
```

**3. Gaps and Missing Concepts:**

1. **Data Privacy Policy:** Missing explicit rules for handling user data, PII, and data retention. Should include:
   - Data minimization principles
   - Right to erasure procedures
   - Data encryption requirements

2. **Error Recovery Procedures:** While there are safety checks, the system lacks documented procedures for:
   - Automatic rollback scenarios
   - Corruption detection and repair
   - Constitutional crisis resolution (e.g., if .intent becomes corrupted)

3. **Testing Policy:** Missing comprehensive rules for:
   - Test coverage requirements
   - Test data management
   - Mocking strategies for external services

4. **Documentation Standards:** Could benefit from:
   - Minimum documentation requirements for capabilities
   - Style guide for docstrings
   - Versioning policy for documentation

5. **Performance Policy:** Missing guidelines for:
   - Acceptable latency for core operations
   - Resource usage limits
   - Scaling considerations

The constitution is remarkably well-designed overall. These suggestions aim to make an already strong system even more robust and complete. The existing principles provide excellent guidance that these changes would help operationalize further.
