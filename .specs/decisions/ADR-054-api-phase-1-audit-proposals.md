# ADR-054 — API Phase 1: /audit + /proposals

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-05-16
**Authors:** Darek (Dariusz Newecki)
**Parent:** ADR-053 (API as Governance Interface)
**Closes:** #335
**Relates to:** ADR-050 (CLI positioning), ADR-010 (Finding/Proposal
contract), ADR-015 (consequence chain), ADR-038 (circuit breaker)

---

## Context

ADR-053 D4 defines Phase 1 as the first capability cluster to receive
API endpoints: `/audit` and `/proposals`. These namespaces back onto
`mind.governance` (audit) and `core.autonomous_proposals` (proposals)
— the two most mature and governance-critical backend surfaces in CORE.

ADR-053 D6 requires this ADR to be accepted before any Phase 1
endpoint is implemented.

**CLI files in scope (Phase 1 migration targets):**

`src/cli/resources/proposals/`:
- `integrate.py`
- `manage.py`
- `list.py`
- `create.py`

`src/cli/resources/code/` (audit-facing only):
- `audit.py`
- `lint.py`

All six carry direct imports from `mind.*`, `will.*`, `body.*`, or
`shared.*`. These are the suppress entries that must reach zero for
#335 to close (D4).

The remaining `src/cli/resources/code/` files (`docstrings.py`,
`format.py`, `fix_atomic.py`, `check_imports.py`, `actions.py`,
`logging.py`, `refactor.py`, `integrity.py`, `test.py`, `check_ui.py`)
are Phase 2/3 and are not in scope here.

## Decisions

### D1 — Audit runs are resources

`POST /audit/runs` creates an audit run and returns `{run_id,
verdict, finding_count}`. `GET /audit/runs/{id}` returns the full
result including findings. CORE already persists audit results to the
DB; the run-as-resource model maps onto existing persistence without
new infrastructure.

### D2 — `/proposals/{id}/execute` is included in the API

The architecture is CLI → API → CORE. Excluding execute from the API
would leave `src/cli/resources/proposals/manage.py` unable to migrate
off its direct `will.*` imports — a permanent `architecture.cli.api_only`
violation. The endpoint is included. It remains a governor-direct
override action; the API surface does not change its semantics.

Full proposals resource contract:
- `GET /proposals` — list with status filter
- `GET /proposals/{id}` — show
- `POST /proposals/{id}/approve` — approve
- `POST /proposals/{id}/reject` — reject
- `POST /proposals/{id}/execute` — governor-direct override

### D3 — No auth for Phase 1; loopback binding only

Single-operator, development phase, loopback-only deployment. No
authentication is required at this stage. The API binds to loopback
only (`127.0.0.1`); no external exposure is sanctioned while this
decision is in force.

Promotion trigger: bearer token authentication is required before CORE
exits single-operator deployment or binds to a non-loopback interface.
That promotion requires a dedicated ADR.

This decision is explicit and deliberate — see `_check_authorization`
stub precedent (commit 5c0ee6b0): deferral must be on record.

### D4 — Phase 1 completion is verified by suppress-entry removal

The following six files must have all `architecture.cli.api_only`
suppress entries removed when Phase 1 is complete. No suppress entries
may remain in these files at #335 closure:

```
src/cli/resources/proposals/integrate.py
src/cli/resources/proposals/manage.py
src/cli/resources/proposals/list.py
src/cli/resources/proposals/create.py
src/cli/resources/code/audit.py
src/cli/resources/code/lint.py
```

## Verification

This ADR is verified when:

1. `GET /proposals`, `GET /proposals/{id}`, `POST
   /proposals/{id}/approve`, `POST /proposals/{id}/reject`, and `POST
   /proposals/{id}/execute` exist, are tested, and return governed
   responses.
2. `POST /audit/runs` and `GET /audit/runs/{id}` exist, are tested,
   and return at minimum `{run_id, verdict, finding_count}` and full
   finding list respectively.
3. All six files listed in D4 import exclusively from `api.*` — no
   `mind.*`, `will.*`, `body.*`, or `shared.*` imports remain.
4. A full audit run reports zero findings under
   `architecture.cli.api_only` attributable to the six D4 files.
