# scripts/demo.sh — watch CORE govern itself, end to end, in one run.
#
# This is the on-ramp demo: it makes CORE detect a real violation, propose a
# fix, approve it, execute it, re-audit to confirm, and then shows you the
# consequence chain CORE recorded about its own action — the believer moment.
#
# It uses the DETERMINISTIC self-healing path (fix.ids), so it needs NO LLM and
# no API key. It does need a running CORE API (install-core.sh starts one).
#
# Safe to re-run: the seeded violation is a single throwaway file that is
# removed at the end. On a fresh clone the only effect on your tree is the
# fix-commit CORE makes (expected — that IS the consequence chain).
#
# Status: v1 — first end-to-end run is on a clean VM (#562). Steps marked
# [VM] are the ones most likely to need tuning once observed on a clean box.
