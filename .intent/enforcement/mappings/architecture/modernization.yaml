        Analyze the provided code for 'Fidelity Scars' from Iterations 1 or 2.
        Identify:
        1. Function signatures with unused variables (e.g., 'output_mode', 'silent').
        2. 'Shim' modules that simply wrap V2 logic to support legacy imports.
        3. Hard-coded logic that violates the 'Everything is Reasoned' vision.

        Provide a concise 'Judicial Opinion' for each finding.
      rationale: "Evolutionary visualization: identifying the ghosts of the past."
