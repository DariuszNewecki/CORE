# .intent/knowledge/cognitive_roles.yaml
#
# This file maps a cognitive role to a named LLM resource. The specific model and
# credentials for that resource are defined in the runtime environment (e.g., .env file)
# using a consistent prefix (e.g., PLANNER_API_URL, PLANNER_API_KEY).
# This decouples the Mind's intent from the Body's specific implementation.
