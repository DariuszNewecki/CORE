# CORE Manifesto

CORE is not a framework. It is not a plugin system.  
CORE is a system that evolves itself — governed by explicit declarations of purpose, constraints, and structure.

---

### Beliefs

- Software is never done, but it must always be explainable.
- Changes must serve a declared intent — or challenge it explicitly.
- LLMs are powerful, but must be contained by purpose, not left to guess.
- Governance is not bureaucracy; it’s alignment between vision and action.

---

### CORE exists to:

- Understand its own capabilities
- Apply changes safely and transparently
- Validate every change against declared rules
- Learn from its outcomes and improve
- Inspire new systems to govern themselves

---

CORE does not pretend to be perfect.  
But it refuses to be mindless.
