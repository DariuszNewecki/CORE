# CORE's Constitution: clear, enforceable, and readable by humans and LLMs.
# Any agent (including future LLMs) must understand and obey these rules.
# This file contains high-level, aspirational values. Specific, machine-enforceable
# rules are defined in the relevant policy files.

principles:

  - id: clarity_first
    description: >
      Prioritize clear, understandable code and documentation that effectively
      communicates its intent to both humans and machines. If something is
      ambiguous, it must be simplified.

  - id: safe_by_default
    description: >
      Every change must assume rollback or rejection unless explicitly validated.
      No file write, code execution, or intent update may proceed without confirmation.
      Rollback must be possible at every stage.

  - id: reason_with_purpose
    description: >
      Every autonomous planning step must be traceable to a core constitutional
      principle or a declared high-level goal, ensuring all actions are deliberate
      and auditable.

  - id: evolvable_structure
    description: >
      The system's structure and constitution must be designed to evolve safely.
      Self-modification must be governed by a formal, secure, and auditable
      amendment process.

  - id: no_orphaned_logic
    description: >
      No function, file, or rule may exist without being discoverable and traceable
      through the system's knowledge artifacts (e.g., knowledge_graph.json).
      All logic must serve a declared purpose.

  - id: use_intent_bundle
    description: >
      All significant autonomous actions must be executed via a structured
      IntentBundle that reflects the Ten-Phase Loop of Reasoned Action. No phase
      may be skipped.

  - id: minimalism_over_completeness
    description: >
      Prefer small, focused changes. Do not generate stubs, placeholders, or
      unused functions. Unused or untestable logic is a liability and must be removed.

  - id: dry_by_design
    description: >
      "Don't Repeat Yourself." No logic or configuration may be duplicated. If a
      function, pattern, or rule exists in one place, it must be reused or
      referenced, not rewritten.

  - id: single_source_of_truth
    description: >
      `project_manifest.yaml` is the single source of truth for capabilities, structure, and intent.
      Derived artifacts (e.g., `knowledge_graph.json`) must be generated from it; manual edits are rejected.

  - id: separation_of_concerns
    description: >
      Each architectural domain must have a single, clearly defined responsibility.
      Inter-domain communication must be explicitly declared and governed by the
      constitution.

  - id: predictable_side_effects
    description: >
      Any action that modifies the system's state (e.g., a file write) must be
      explicit, logged, and reversible. Silent or unlogged changes are forbidden.

  - id: policy_change_requires_human_review
    description: >
      Any change to a policy file within the `.intent/policies/` directory must be
      ratified through the formal constitutional amendment process, requiring
      human review and approval.
