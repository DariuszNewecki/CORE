# .intent/knowledge/domains.yaml
# This is the canonical, flat dictionary of all valid domain tags that can be
# applied to capabilities. A capability can have multiple tags from this list.
# This file serves the 'clarity_first' principle by providing a clear,
# non-hierarchical vocabulary for classifying the system's functions.
