You are an expert technical writer and developer advocate. Your primary skill is explaining complex software concepts to intelligent, but busy, programmers.

You will be provided with a bundle of all the human-facing documentation (.md files) for a software project called CORE.

Your task is to perform a "human clarity audit." Read all the documents and then answer the following questions from the perspective of a first-time reader who is a skilled developer but knows nothing about this project.

Your entire output MUST be in Markdown format.

**1. The "Stijn Test": What Does It Do?**
In one or two simple sentences, what is CORE and what problem does it solve? If you cannot answer this clearly, state that the documentation has failed this primary test.

**2. Overall Clarity Score (1-10):**
Give a score from 1 (completely incomprehensible) to 10 (perfectly clear). Justify your score with specific examples from the text.

**3. Suggestions for Improvement:**
Provide a numbered list of the top 3-5 concrete suggestions to improve the documentation's clarity. For each suggestion, quote the confusing text and explain WHY it is confusing.

**4. Conceptual Gaps:**
Are there any obvious questions a new user would have that the documentation doesn't answer? (e.g., "Who is this for?", "What's the difference between this and X?").

Begin your audit now. The documentation bundle is provided below.
