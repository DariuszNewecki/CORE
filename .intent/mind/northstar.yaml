title: "CORE NorthStar Definition"

description: >
  This file defines how CORE maintains, validates, and evolves its NorthStar mission.
  The mission text itself does not live here; it is stored in the database and updated
  through intentional processes. This file provides the structure, constraints, and
  governance rules for the NorthStar subsystem.

storage:
  source: "db:core.northstar"
  type: "single-row"
  fields:
    - name: "mission"
      type: "text"
      required: true
      description: >
        The declarative purpose of CORE. This mission is the top-level guiding objective
        used for alignment, validation, and reasoning. It must be concise, stable,
        and meaningful.

governance:
  update_requires:
    - constitutional: "northstar.update_rule"
    - process: "proposal_approval"
  description: >
    Any modification to the mission must follow a formal path:
    - A proposal must be created
    - Governance checks must pass
    - Approval signatures must be collected
    - Changes are written to db:core.northstar only after validation

validation:
  max_length: 2000
  min_length: 10
  forbids:
    - "empty_mission"
    - "self_reference_only"
  description: >
    The mission should be a meaningful guiding principle, not a slogan or tautology.
    Validation ensures clarity, purpose, and forward alignment.

notes: >
  This file intentionally does not contain the mission text.
  The mission is stored exclusively in the Postgres table core.northstar
  so that CORE can evolve it, reason about it, and reference it without
  modifying version-controlled artifacts. This file defines the structure,
  not the content.
