name: "CORE"
title: "CORE — Self-Improving Software Engineering System"

description: >
  High-level manifest for CORE. 
  This file does not duplicate ontology or capability definitions.
  Instead, it declares where CORE should look for the authoritative sources
  of truth across its Mind, Body, and Governance layers.

northstar:
  source: "db:core.northstar"
  description: >
    The NorthStar mission lives in Postgres as a single-row table
    and is loaded during system initialization.

    links:  "db:core.symbol_capability_links"
    domains_table: "db:core.domains"
    description: >
      Capability definitions, ownership, and relationships are stored
      in the database and discovered from the codebase.

notes: >
  This manifest intentionally avoids enumerating capabilities,
  symbols, domains, or agents directly. These are dynamically
  discovered from the codebase and database and evolve as CORE evolves.
  The manifest’s purpose is only to provide stable pointers to
  authoritative data sources across the system.
