# CORE Charter

**Status:** Founding Charter

**Scope:** Entire CORE system

**Location of Authority:** `.intent/REBIRTH/`

---

## 1. Purpose

This Charter declares the founding intent of CORE in its reborn form.

It exists to orient contributors, tools, and future maintainers by making explicit:

* what CORE is,
* what CORE is not,
* where authority resides,
* and how the system must be read during this phase.

This Charter is not a specification.
It is a declaration of standing.

---

## 2. Foundational Reset

CORE is undergoing a constitutional rebirth.

This rebirth:

* does **not** preserve backward compatibility,
* does **not** assume continuity of prior governance models,
* does **not** require legacy enforcement mechanisms to remain relevant.

Past artifacts are retained for reference only.
They do not constrain the reborn Constitution.

---

## 3. Authority Statement

Effective immediately:

* Constitutional authority resides exclusively in:

  * `.intent/REBIRTH/constitution/`
  * `.intent/REBIRTH/papers/`

* No other directory under `.intent/` is authoritative for constitutional law.

Legacy policies, schemas, standards, and META documents are suspended as sources of authority.

They may inform future work, but they do not bind it.

---

## 4. Reading Order

To understand CORE in its reborn form, the following reading order applies:

1. `REBIRTH/constitution/CORE-CONSTITUTION-v0.md`
2. All documents in `REBIRTH/papers/`
3. This Charter

Any contradiction must be resolved in favor of the Constitution, then the papers, then this Charter.

---

## 5. Suspension of Legacy Semantics

During the rebirth phase:

* Folder structure outside `REBIRTH/` has no legal meaning.
* File naming conventions outside `REBIRTH/` imply no authority.
* Existing auditors, checks, engines, and schemas are non-authoritative.

Their continued existence does not imply endorsement.

---

## 6. Intentional Incompleteness

CORE is intentionally incomplete at this stage.

Missing elements are not defects.
They are evidence that law precedes machinery.

No schema, engine, or tool may be introduced to compensate for incomplete law.

---

## 7. Change Discipline

Changes to reborn CORE must follow this order:

1. Amend constitutional papers.
2. Re-evaluate derived understanding.
3. Only then derive implementation artifacts.

Skipping steps constitutes a governance violation.

---

## 8. Duration

This Charter remains in force until explicitly retired or superseded by a formal constitutional amendment.

Silence does not revoke it.

---

## 9. Closing Statement

CORE is not being refactored.

CORE is being re-founded.

This Charter exists to make that fact unambiguous.
