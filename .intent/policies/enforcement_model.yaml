# single, canonical source of truth for the definition of all enforcement
# levels used in CORE's governance policies.

enforcement_levels:
  - level: hard
    description: >
      A non-negotiable rule. If a proposed action violates a 'hard' policy,
      the action MUST be automatically rejected by the system's IntentGuard.
      No override is possible without a formal, approved constitutional amendment
      to the policy itself. This is the highest level of enforcement.

  - level: soft
    description: >
      A strong guideline. If a proposed action violates a 'soft' policy, the
      system's IntentGuard MUST log a formal WARNING. However, the action is
      allowed to proceed. This is used for rules that are important but may have
      valid exceptions, or for new rules being phased in.

  - level: manual_review
    description: >
      A gate that requires human intervention. If a proposed action violates a
      'manual_review' policy, the system MUST pause the execution and require
      formal, cryptographic proof of human intent before proceeding. This is
      typically handled via the 'core-admin proposals-approve' workflow.
