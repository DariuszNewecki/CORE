# .intent/policies/agent_reasoning_policy.yaml
#
# This policy governs the cognitive process of all autonomous agents, ensuring
# their actions are based on an accurate self-image and a respect for existing
# capabilities. It is the constitutional safeguard against stale knowledge and
# redundant work.

rules:
  - id: reason_from_reality
    description: >
      An agent's reasoning must always be based on the current, true state of the
      codebase. The Knowledge Graph must be considered "dirty" and must be
      regenerated after any action that modifies source code.
    enforcement: hard
    # This is a conceptual check; the orchestrator must implement this logic.
    precondition_for_planning: "knowledge_graph_timestamp > last_code_modification_timestamp"

  - id: reuse_before_building
    description: >
      Before generating any new function or class, an agent's PLAN must include
      a step that explicitly justifies why an existing, similar capability cannot
      be reused.
    enforcement: soft # Starts as 'soft' to allow for logging, can be hardened later.
    # The agent's PLAN object would need a new field for this justification.

      - "Query sent to Knowledge Graph for similar capabilities."
      - "LLM-generated rationale for why reuse is not feasible."
