# .intent/policies/audit_ignore.yaml
#
# Defines file and directory patterns that the Constitutional Auditor
# should intentionally ignore during its "orphaned file" check.
# This prevents warnings for files that are intentionally not indexed
# in meta.yaml, such as private keys.

ignore_patterns:
  # For security, the private key store is never indexed or exported.
  - ".intent/keys/"

  # Temporary files that should not be considered part of the constitution.
  - ".lock"
  - ".bak"

  # Example files are not part of the active constitution.
  - ".example"
