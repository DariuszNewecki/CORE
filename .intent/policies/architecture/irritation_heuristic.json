  "description": "Defines how CORE interprets repeated human irritation or friction\nwith specific parts of the system as a governance-level signal of\nstructural misalignment or drift.\nThe heuristic does not grant permission to change anything by itself;\nit prioritizes investigation and remediation within existing\nconstitutional constraints.\n",
  "intent": "Convert human qualitative discomfort into a structured, inspectable\nsignal that can guide introspection, refactor proposals, and\nautonomous refinement workflows, without bypassing governance.\n",
  "motivations": [
    "Humans detect misalignment and drift before they can fully articulate it.",
    "AI sees structure but does not feel friction or annoyance.",
    "Repeated irritation usually indicates deeper architectural or domain issues.",
