description: >
  Convert natural language user intent into canonical task structure.
  This is the constitutional entry point for the Will layer.

  Interpret bridges ungoverned (human communication) with governed (system execution).

inputs:
  - user_request # Natural language goal
  - conversation_context # Optional: prior conversation state
  - available_workflows # Optional: valid workflow types

outputs:
  - task_structure # Canonical task definition
  - workflow_type # Inferred or explicit workflow selection
  - clarification_needed # Boolean: requires user input

constitutional_requirements:
  - governance.no_governance_bypass
  - autonomy.tracing.mandatory

notes: >
  INTERPRET is the first constitutional phase.

  It does NOT have authority to execute - only to propose task structures
  that will be validated in subsequent phases.

  Failure mode is 'clarify' rather than 'block' because ambiguous input
  should result in dialogue, not rejection.

  This phase completes the Mind-Body-Will architecture by giving the Will
  layer a constitutional entry point with clear boundaries.
