  \ architecture of the project.\n\n## Core Components\n\n### Client Layer\nThe client\
  \ layer handles interactions with external AI services through the `CognitiveService`\
  \ class. This service provides a unified interface for various AI capabilities including\
  \ language models, speech recognition, and computer vision.\n\n**Key Class:**\n\
  - `CognitiveService`: Main service for interacting with Azure Cognitive Services\
  \ and other AI providers\n\n### Service Layer\nThe service layer contains business\
  \ logic and orchestrates interactions between different components. Services depend\
  \ on the client layer for AI capabilities.\n\n### Data Layer\nThe data layer manages\
  \ persistence and data access through repositories and database connections.\n\n\
  ## Service Integration\n\nAll AI service interactions should use the `CognitiveService`\
  \ through dependency injection:\n\n```python\nfrom core.services import CognitiveService\n\
  \nclass MyService:\n    def __init__(self, cognitive_service: CognitiveService):\n\
  \        self.cognitive_service = cognitive_service\n```\n\n## API Endpoints\n\n\
  The web API exposes endpoints that leverage the `CognitiveService` for AI capabilities:\n\
  \n- `/api/chat` - For conversational AI interactions\n- `/api/vision` - For image\
  \ analysis\n- `/api/speech` - For speech processing\n\n## Configuration\n\nService\
  \ configuration is managed through environment variables and config files, focusing\
  \ on Azure Cognitive Services endpoints and credentials.\n```"
justification: Update architectural documentation to remove references to BaseLLMClient
  and document the use of CognitiveService as the standard client interface
