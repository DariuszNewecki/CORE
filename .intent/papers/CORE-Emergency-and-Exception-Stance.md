# CORE — Emergency and Exception Stance

**Status:** Constitutional Semantics Paper

**Scope:** All CORE-governed phases and actions

**Authority:** Constitution-level (derivative, non-primitive)

---

## 1. Purpose

This paper defines CORE’s position on emergencies, exceptions, and so-called “break-glass” mechanisms.

Its purpose is to prevent the introduction of implicit sovereignty, ad-hoc overrides, or situational reinterpretation of law under operational pressure.

---

## 2. No Emergency Sovereignty

CORE does **not** recognize emergency sovereignty.

There exists no condition under which law may be suspended, bypassed, or overridden due to urgency, crisis, or operational pressure.

Situations do not create authority.

---

## 3. No Exception Mechanisms

CORE does **not** permit exception mechanisms.

Specifically forbidden are:

* emergency override flags,
* privileged bypass paths,
* temporary suspension of rules,
* hidden "break-glass" logic,
* time-limited exemptions not expressed as rules.

Any such mechanism constitutes implicit law and violates the Constitution.

---

## 4. Handling Unrepresentable Situations

If a situation cannot be represented within existing CORE law, the system must not improvise.

Permitted responses are limited to:

1. Blocking execution.
2. Halting progression at the current Phase.
3. Initiating constitutional replacement (REBIRTH).

Operational continuity is subordinate to constitutional correctness.

---

## 5. Relationship to Amendment Mechanism

Situations requiring exceptions are evidence of insufficient law.

They must be addressed through explicit constitutional replacement, not temporary measures.

Emergency pressure does not justify deviation from amendment discipline.

---

## 6. Auditability of Pressure

While exceptions are forbidden, the *presence of emergency pressure* may be observed and recorded.

Observation:

* carries no authority,
* grants no permission,
* does not alter evaluation outcomes.

Its sole purpose is post-fact analysis and governance improvement.

---

## 7. Rejection of Gradual Erosion

CORE explicitly rejects the principle of gradual erosion of law through repeated exceptions.

No accumulation of past emergencies may establish precedent.

Precedent remains non-existent.

---

## 8. Amendment Discipline

This paper may be amended only by explicit constitutional replacement, in accordance with the CORE amendment mechanism.

---

## 9. Closing Statement

CORE chooses correctness over continuity.

When law is insufficient, CORE changes the law — it does not break it.
