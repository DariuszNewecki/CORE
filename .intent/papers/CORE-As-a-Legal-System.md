# CORE as a Legal System, Not a Framework

## Abstract

This paper positions CORE explicitly as a legal system rather than a software framework. While frameworks optimize developer productivity and reuse, legal systems optimize legitimacy, predictability, and restraint. CORE adopts legal-system properties intentionally to govern acting systems without drifting into tooling-driven authority or interpretive enforcement.

---

## 1. Alignment Statement

CORE is not a framework.

It does not aim to:

* simplify development,
* accelerate delivery,
* maximize flexibility,
* optimize ergonomics.

CORE aims to define what is *allowed*.

---

## 2. Frameworks vs Legal Systems

### 2.1 Characteristics of Frameworks

Frameworks typically:

* provide abstractions,
* encourage extension,
* tolerate interpretation,
* evolve by accretion.

These properties are incompatible with stable governance.

---

### 2.2 Characteristics of Legal Systems

Legal systems:

* define explicit law,
* limit authority,
* resist extension,
* treat silence as prohibition.

CORE deliberately adopts these characteristics.

---

## 3. Law as the Primary Artifact

In CORE:

* documents are law,
* rules are statutes,
* phases are jurisdictional boundaries,
* authority defines standing.

Code is an enforcement mechanism, not a source of law.

---

## 4. Interpretation Is a Governance Failure

Legal systems tolerate interpretation only where ambiguity exists.

CORE minimizes ambiguity by construction:

* atomic rules,
* deterministic evaluation,
* explicit authority.

When interpretation is required, governance has already failed.

---

## 5. Silence as Prohibition

In CORE, absence is meaningful.

If something is not explicitly allowed by law, it is not allowed.

This principle prevents gradual expansion of authority through convenience.

---

## 6. Precedent Is Not Law

CORE does not recognize precedent.

Past behavior:

* does not create permission,
* does not imply authority,
* does not justify continuation.

Only declared law governs future action.

---

## 7. Amendment Discipline

Legal systems evolve through amendment, not drift.

CORE requires:

* explicit constitutional change,
* acceptance of breaking effects,
* rejection of silent compatibility guarantees.

---

## 8. Role of Tooling

Tooling may:

* visualize law,
* propose changes,
* assist evaluation.

Tooling may not:

* create law,
* override law,
* reinterpret law.

---

## 9. Why This Matters for Acting Systems

Acting systems amplify small governance defects into systemic risk.

By treating governance as law rather than configuration, CORE provides:

* predictable constraints,
* bounded autonomy,
* auditable legitimacy.

---

## 10. Conclusion

CORE’s effectiveness depends on resisting the temptation to behave like a framework. By embracing its role as a legal system, CORE maintains clarity, authority discipline, and long-term stability—at the cost of convenience. This cost is intentional.
