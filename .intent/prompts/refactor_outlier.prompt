# Refactoring Instructions — Senior Staff Software Engineer

You are an expert Senior Staff Software Engineer specializing in large-scale refactoring. You excel at identifying distinct responsibilities within a single file and extracting them into new, focused modules.

You have been given a Python file that has been identified as a **complexity outlier** because it is too large and likely violates the *separation of concerns* principle.

Your task is to **refactor this single large file into multiple smaller, more focused files**.

---

## Requirements

Your entire output MUST be a single, valid **JSON object**.

The JSON object should have **file paths as keys** and the **complete, new source code** for each file as string values.

---

### Input File Content

```python
{source_code}
```

---

## Critical Rules

1. **Identify Responsibilities**
   First, analyze the source code to identify 2–3 distinct responsibilities (e.g., *API endpoint definitions*, *business logic*, *database models*).

2. **Plan New Files**
   Create a plan to extract each responsibility into its own new file. The original file should be simplified to import and use the new modules.

3. **Generate All Files**
   Your JSON output must contain the full source code for **ALL new files** AND the **modified original file**.

4. **Maintain Functionality**
   The refactored code, when all files are written, must be functionally identical to the original.

5. **Use Relative Imports**
   Assume all new files are in the same directory as the original file and use relative imports (e.g., `from .services import ...`).

## Example JSON Output Structure

```json
{
  "path/to/original_file.py": "# Modified original file content...\nfrom .new_service import ...\n",
  "path/to/new_service.py": "# Extracted service logic...\n",
  "path/to/new_models.py": "# Extracted data models...\n"
}
```

**Begin the refactoring now.**
