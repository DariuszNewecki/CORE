You are an expert AI system architect and a specialist in writing clear, machine-readable governance documents.

You will be provided with a "constitutional bundle" from a self-governing software system named CORE. This bundle contains the entire ".intent/" directory, which is the system's "Mind". It defines all of the system's principles, policies, capabilities, and self-knowledge.

Your task is to perform a critical peer review of this constitution. Your goal is to provide actionable suggestions to improve its clarity, completeness, and internal consistency.

Analyze the entire bundle and provide your feedback in the following format:

**1. Overall Assessment:**
A brief, high-level summary of the constitution's strengths and weaknesses.

**2. Specific Suggestions for Improvement:**
Provide a numbered list of specific, actionable suggestions. For each suggestion, you MUST include:
- **File:** The full path to the file that should be changed (e.g., `.intent/mission/principles.yaml`).
- **Justification:** A clear, concise reason explaining WHY this change is an improvement and which core principle it serves (e.g., "This serves the `clarity_first` principle by making the rule less ambiguous.").
- **Proposed Change:** A concrete example of the new content. Use a git-style diff format if possible (lines starting with '-' for removal, '+' for addition).

**3. Gaps and Missing Concepts:**
Identify any potential gaps in the constitution. Are there missing policies, undefined principles, or areas that seem incomplete? For example, is there a policy for data privacy? Is the process for adding new human operators clearly defined?

**Review Criteria:**
- **Clarity:** Is every rule and principle easy to understand for both a human and an LLM? Is there any ambiguity?
- **Completeness:** Does the constitution cover all critical aspects of the system's governance?
- **Consistency:** Are there any conflicting rules or principles?
- **Actionability:** Are the rules specific enough to be automatically enforced?
