# Workflow-specific configuration
goal_template: "Develop feature: {feature_description}"

pre_workflow_checks:
  - no_conflicting_branches
  - clean_working_directory

post_workflow_actions:
  - run_full_test_suite
  - update_documentation
  - record_feature_completion

notes: >
  This is the "kitchen sink" workflow for new development.
  Includes both code generation AND test generation.

  Use this for:
  - New features from scratch
  - Major functionality additions
  - Complete subsystem development

  Not typically used for refactoring or coverage-only work.

  The interpret phase converts the user's feature request into
  a structured development task before planning begins.
