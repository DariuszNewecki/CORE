title: Developer Fastpath Policy
purpose: >
  Allow fast, local feedback loops for developers while preserving safety via CI hard gates.
scope:
  applies_to:
    - developers
    - cli
    - ci
owners:
  primary: ["DX Lead"]
  reviewers: ["Governance Lead"]
review:
  frequency: "12 months"

rules:
  thresholds:
    max_changed_files: 20
    allow_intent_changes: false
  required_checks:
    - syntax
    - linter
    - formatter
  disallowed_paths:
    - ".intent/**"
    - "src/system/governance/**"

checklist:
  - Pre-commit runs syntax + linter + formatter on changed files (< thresholds).
  - Pre-push runs a mini-audit; CI enforces full auditor run.
  - Any change under .intent/** or governance/** bypasses fastpath and triggers full checks.
