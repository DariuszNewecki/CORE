title: "Architectural Principles That Cannot Be Changed"
description: >
  This file defines the bedrock laws of the system architecture.
  Unlike standard policies, these rules guard the fundamental integrity of
  CORE. They cannot be modified, relaxed, or removed without a
  UNANIMOUS QUORUM of all active human approvers.

immutable_rules:
  - rule_id: "no_decorator_pollution"
    statement: "Source code MUST NOT contain metadata decorators beyond @dataclass or standard library functional wrappers."
    rationale: "The Database is the SSOT. Metadata decorators create a split-brain state and pollute business logic."
    immutable_until: "unanimous_quorum"

  - rule_id: "action_result_contract"
    statement: "All internal atomic action functions MUST return a validated ActionResult object."
    rationale: "A universal contract is required for reliable autonomous orchestration and auditing."
    immutable_until: "unanimous_quorum"

  - rule_id: "write_defaults_false"
    statement: "All functions with a 'write' or 'modify' side-effect parameter MUST default it to False."
    rationale: "Safety-by-default. The system must never be destructive without explicit intent."
    immutable_until: "critical_quorum"

  - rule_id: "db_is_ssot"
    statement: "The PostgreSQL database is the SINGLE source of truth for all operational data (capabilities, history, links)."
    rationale: "Prevents state drift between filesystem and runtime. Filesystem is for logic; DB is for state."
    immutable_until: "unanimous_quorum"

  - rule_id: "ids_only_pollution"
    statement: "The ONLY allowed metadata intrusion in source code is the stable '# ID: <uuid>' tag."
    rationale: "Stable IDs are necessary for refactoring; all other metadata belongs in the SSOT."
    immutable_until: "unanimous_quorum"

enforcement:
  - "Any proposal modifying these rules requires the quorum level specified in 'immutable_until'."
  - "Proposals that indirectly violate these rules (e.g., by introducing decorators) are constitutionally auto-rejected."
  - "The Constitutional Guard must validate all code changes against these principles during the build/audit phase."
