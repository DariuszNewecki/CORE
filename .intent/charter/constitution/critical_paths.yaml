description: >
  Registry of files and directories that require CRITICAL quorum for any modification.
  This list defines the immune system of CORE. ANY change to files matching these
  paths must meet the critical quorum threshold defined in approvers.yaml.

paths:
  # === CORE CONSTITUTION ===
  # The foundation cannot be changed easily
  - ".intent/meta.yaml"
  - ".intent/charter/constitution/**/*.yaml"

  # === ALL POLICIES ===
  # Policies define the rules of the road. Modifying them changes the law.
  - ".intent/charter/policies/**/*.yaml"

  # === PATTERNS ===
  # Architectural patterns are constitutional laws for structure.
  - ".intent/charter/patterns/**/*.yaml"

  # === GOVERNANCE SCHEMAS ===
  # Schemas define the shape of laws and interactions.
  - ".intent/charter/schemas/governance/**/*.json"
  - ".intent/charter/schemas/constitutional/**/*.json"

  # === CORE SCHEMAS ===
  # Fundamental contracts (like ActionResult)
  - ".intent/charter/schemas/core/**/*.json"

  # === ENFORCEMENT CODE ===
  # The code that explicitly validates and enforces the constitution.
  # Modifying the police requires the highest authority.
