# This file defines the human operators authorized to approve constitutional
# changes and the rules governing that process.

# ========================================================================
# HUMAN OPERATOR LIFECYCLE PROCEDURES
# ========================================================================
# This section documents the formal procedures for managing approvers.
# All changes to the 'approvers' list must follow these procedures.
#
# --- Onboarding a New Approver ---
# 1. The new operator must generate a key pair using:
#    `poetry run core-admin keygen "new.operator@example.com"`
# 2. A current, authorized approver must create a formal proposal to add
#    the new operator's public key block to the 'approvers' list below.
# 3. The proposal must be signed and approved, meeting the required quorum.
#
# --- Standard Revocation of an Approver ---
# 1. An authorized approver must create a formal proposal to remove the
#    operator's block from the 'approvers' list.
# 2. The justification must clearly state the reason for revocation.
# 3. The proposal must be signed and approved, meeting the required quorum.
#
# --- Emergency Revocation of a Compromised Key ---
# 1. If a private key is compromised, any active approver can issue an
#    emergency revocation proposal.
# 2. This proposal must meet the 'critical' quorum.
# 3. The compromised approver is immediately considered invalid for quorum
#    calculations once the proposal is created.
