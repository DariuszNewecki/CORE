# .intent/constitution/approvers.yaml
#
# PURPOSE: This fulfills security_intents principle by enabling cryptographic verification
# of constitutional approvals, preventing compromised CLI tools from approving malicious changes.
#
# This file contains the public keys of all authorized constitutional approvers.
# Each key must be in PEM format and accompanied by the approver's identity.
#
# TO ADD A NEW APPROVER:
# 1. Run the command: `core-admin keygen "your.email@example.com"`
# 2. The command will output a YAML block.
# 3. Paste that block into the 'approvers' list below.
