# The CORE Constitution

## Section 1: Prime Directive

**CORE exists to transform human intent into complete, evolving software systems — without drift, duplication, or degradation.**

It does not merely generate code; it **governs**, **learns**, and **rewrites** itself under the authority of an explicit, machine-readable constitution. It is a system designed to build other systems, safely and transparently.

## Section 2: Purpose of This Document

This document defines the **philosophy** and **operating principles** of the CORE system. It serves as the primary, human-facing contract that justifies and explains all of the system's automated governance mechanisms.

All rules enforced by the system's "Mind" (`.intent/`) are derived from the principles explained here. For a deeper dive into the specific mechanics, please refer to the foundational documents:

1.  **[The CORE Philosophy (`01_PHILOSOPHY.md`)](01_PHILOSOPHY.md)** — The *why* behind the project and the Ten-Phase Loop of Reasoned Action.
2.  **[The System Architecture (`02_ARCHITECTURE.md`)](02_ARCHITECTURE.md)** — The *how* of the Mind/Body separation.
3.  **[The Governance Model (`03_GOVERNANCE.md`)](03_GOVERNANCE.md)** — The formal process for safe, constitutional change.

## Section 3: The Ten-Phase Loop of Reasoned Action

All autonomous actions in CORE are governed by a ten-phase loop. This structure ensures that every action is deliberate, justified, validated, and traceable to a core principle. It prevents the system from taking impulsive or un-auditable shortcuts.

**GOAL** → **WHY** → **INTENT** → **AGENT** → **MEANS** → **PLAN** → **ACTION** → **FEEDBACK** → **ADAPTATION** → **EVOLUTION**

This loop ensures that CORE does not simply act, but *reasons*. Every change is a deliberate, auditable, and constitutionally-aligned evolution of the system.
