# CORE Governance Model

CORE is not just a codebase — it is a *governed system*.
Every change, whether written by a human or generated by an AI agent, must follow constitutional rules defined in the `.intent/` directory.

Governance in CORE answers one question:

> **How can a system evolve safely without losing structure, intent, or control?**

This document explains exactly how.

---

## 🚦 1. Governance Overview

CORE’s governance approach ensures that:

* No code bypasses constitutional rules.
* No AI agent can write arbitrary files.
* No human can modify `.intent/` without approval.
* Every change is audited.
* Every update to the Mind is justified and validated.

Governance is enforced through:

1. **Policies**
2. **Constitutional Auditor**
3. **Knowledge Graph**
4. **Capability System**
5. **Proposal + Ratification workflow**

Together, these components prevent drift and guarantee safe evolution.

---

## 🧠 2. The Constitutional Layer (`.intent/`)

The `.intent/` directory is the foundation of governance. It is where CORE stores its:

* **Policies** (rules)
* **Domains** (architectural boundaries)
* **Schemas** (validation for policies and configurations)
* **Knowledge** (representations of files, symbols, and capabilities)
* **Governance metadata** (approvers, thresholds, workflows)
* **Proposals** (pending constitutional changes)

Nothing outside `.intent/` can override rules defined inside it.

### 2.1. `.intent/` Structure

```
.intent/
├── mission/                  # Principles and north-star definitions
├── policies/                 # All enforceable rules
├── knowledge/                # Knowledge Graph, symbol metadata
├── config/                   # Environment, runtime, safety rules
├── constitution/             # Approvers, voting, versioning
├── schemas/                  # JSON Schemas
└── proposals/                # Pending constitutional amendments (drafts)
```

Only the **governed workflow** is allowed to modify this directory.

Editing `.intent/` directly is forbidden.

---

## 🔍 3. The Constitutional Auditor (`src/mind/governance/`)

The **Constitutional Auditor** is the Mind’s enforcement engine.
It runs every time:

* a crate is generated,
* a change is proposed,
* a workflow executes,
* or a developer explicitly runs `core-admin check audit`.

### 3.1. Components of the Auditor

* `audit_context.py` — gathers required state
* `auditor.py` — orchestrates checks
* `checks/` — dozens of policy checks, including:

  * coverage checks
  * capability coverage
  * ID uniqueness
  * import rules
  * domain placement
  * file header rules
  * drift detection
  * security policies

### 3.2. Goals of the Auditor

1. Ensure **no change** violates constitutional constraints.
2. Detect **drift** between implementation and intent.
3. Enforce **schema compliance**.
4. Maintain **structural integrity** of the project.

If a violation is found, the change is rejected.

---

## 🗃 4. Policies: How Rules Are Stored

Policies define allowed and forbidden behavior.
They live under:

```
.intent/policies/
```

Each policy includes:

* `policy_id` — permanent UUID
* `title` — human-readable name
* `purpose` — why the rule exists
* `rules` — enforceable constraints

Example categories:

* **Code Standards** — naming, import grouping, formatting
* **Governance Policies** — proposal process, ratification requirements
* **Quality Assurance** — coverage thresholds, lint rules
* **Domain Boundaries** — what can import what

The Auditor loads these and applies them to the Body.

---

## 🧬 5. Knowledge Graph (Symbols & Capabilities)

CORE continuously constructs and maintains a **Knowledge Graph** representing the system.

This graph is built from:

* `# ID:` tags inside the code
* Symbols (functions, classes, modules)
* Capabilities (semantic actions the system can perform)
* Relationships and dependencies

Stored in `.intent/knowledge/`, it enables:

* drift detection,
* capability-based reasoning,
* safe planning for agents,
* architectural enforcement.

When the Knowledge Graph updates, the Mind gains a new understanding of the system.

---

## 🏛 6. The Proposal Workflow (Changing the Constitution)

No one — not even agents — can modify `.intent/` directly.
Every change must follow the amendment process.

### 6.1. Step 1 — Create Proposal

A proposal is a YAML file placed in:

```
.intent/proposals/
```

Example fields include:

* target file in `.intent/`
* justification
* content changes
* signature (human key required)

Proposals are **drafts**. They have no effect yet.

### 6.2. Step 2 — Human Signature

The proposal must be signed with a key generated via:

```bash
poetry run core-admin keys keygen "your.email@example.com"
```

CORE verifies that:

* the signer is authorized,
* signature matches registered identity,
* signature belongs to one of the approved approvers.

### 6.3. Step 3 — Canary Validation

Before applying any constitutional change, CORE runs a **canary check**:

* clones the system and `.intent/` in memory,
* applies the proposal to the clone,
* runs a full audit inside the clone.

If anything fails → **proposal rejected**.
If everything passes → **proposal approved**.

### 6.4. Step 4 — Application

If approved, CORE writes the change to `.intent/`.
The live system remains safe at all times.

---

## 🛡 7. Protection Mechanisms

CORE includes several layers of defense:

### 7.1. IntentGuard

Prevent direct writes into `.intent/`. Only proposal workflows may modify it.

### 7.2. Audit Gates

Block merges or modifications when:

* schema violations occur,
* coverage drops below threshold,
* ID/capability drift detected,
* domain boundaries violated.

### 7.3. Signature & Identity

Every constitutional action must be explicitly signed by a human.

### 7.4. Reversible & Inspectable

All proposals remain recorded. Nothing disappears.

---

## 🔄 8. Governance Lifecycle

### 8.1. Code Lifecycle (Body)

* Developer writes code
* Self-healing fixes metadata
* Knowledge sync updates symbols
* Auditor validates
* Commit allowed only if compliant

### 8.2. Autonomous Development Lifecycle (Will)

* Agent generates crate
* Validation & audit run
* Crate accepted or rejected

### 8.3. Constitutional Lifecycle (Mind)

* Proposal created
* Human signs
* Canary check runs
* Proposal ratified
* Mind evolves

Each layer is governed differently — but all revolve around the Constitution.

---

## 🎯 9. Why Governance Matters

Without governance:

* AI becomes unsafe
* Architecture collapses over time
* Decisions are undocumented
* Knowledge disappears
* Code becomes unmaintainable

CORE prevents this through:

* traceability,
* constitutional enforcement,
* permanent intent storage,
* safe autonomous capabilities,
* explicit human oversight.

Governance is not a feature — it is the foundation.
