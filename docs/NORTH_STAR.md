# CORE North Star

**Goal:** Turn high-level goals into governed, safe, running software — autonomously.

**Invariant:** Safety never degrades. Every change is proven aligned to intent before it lands (policies, tests, canary audit).

## The Autonomy Ladder

- **A0 · Observe** — Attach to any repo, build knowledge graph, run auditor (read-only).
- **A1 · Propose** — Open PRs with small, safe fixes (docstrings, capability tags, logging). Human merges.
- **A2 · Governed Writes** — Canary-validated changes self-apply with policy (human optional by risk tier).
- **A3 · BYOR** — CORE-fy arbitrary repos (including CORE), propose structure, capabilities, tests.
- **A4 · Birth New Apps** — From a goal, scaffold feature-first app (Mind/Body), tests, CI/CD.
- **A5 · Continuous Intent Dev** — Roadmap evolves in natural language; CORE plans, implements, releases within risk budgets.

## Guardrails
- **Risk tiers:** auto-merge only for low-risk scopes at first.
- **Evidence gates:** static policies + tests + canary must pass.
- **Idempotence:** ingestion produces stable results; re-runs don’t thrash.
- **Kill switch:** rollback on anomaly/error-budget breach.

## KPIs
- Auditor errors/warnings → sustained zero
- % code with capability tags
- Proposal acceptance rate / MTTR
- % PRs generated by CORE
- % no-human releases by risk tier
- Post-merge incident rate

## Current Status
- Project status: **Architectural Prototype**.
- Targeting **M1 (A0→A1)**: CORE overlay, CI audit, auto-PRs for docstrings/tags/logging.
