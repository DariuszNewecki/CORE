# Strategic Plan — Early Draft *(Archived)*

This file captured early strategic thoughts for CORE during its conceptual phase.
It mixes vision, direction-setting, and early hypotheses about autonomy and architecture.

The modern plan is now fully described under:

* `core-concept/00_WHAT_IS_CORE.md`
* `core-concept/02_ARCHITECTURE.md`
* `planning/01-complete-implementation-plan.md`
* `autonomy-and-governance/constitutional-coverage/*`

Everything below is preserved for historical completeness.

# 1. Early Vision Summary (Archived)

CORE was originally conceptualized as:

* a self-improving system,
* capable of generating its own code,
* governed by a constitutional rule layer,
* driven by autonomous agents,
* validated through continuous tests and audits.

This vision remains directionally correct but has since been significantly refined.

---

# 2. Early Architecture Outline (Archived)

The initial architecture assumed:

* autonomous background daemons,
* continuous monitoring agents,
* self-triggering code generation,
* looser governance boundaries.

Since then, the architecture matured to:

* explicit, CLI-driven autonomy,
* strict Mind–Body–Will boundaries,
* a unified crate pipeline,
* explicit constitutional audits,
* no background daemons.

---

# 3. Draft Objectives (Archived)

Early objectives included:

* full autonomy from natural-language instruction,
* self-refactoring codebase,
* autonomous test generation,
* evolving architecture without human intervention.

These have been reshaped into governed phases:

```
A1 → A1.5 → A2 → A3 → A4
```

# 4. Early Roadmap (Archived)

The roadmap below is preserved exactly as it appeared conceptually:

## Phase 0 — Prototype

* basic LLM calls
* raw, uncontrolled codegen
* manual validation

## Phase 1 — Autonomous Development

* crate mechanism
* basic planning
* audit + tests gating
* semi-structured generation

## Phase 2 — Self-Improvement

* agents update codebase automatically
* background loops *(deprecated)*
* structural reasoning

## Phase 3 — Auto-Evolve

* rules update themselves
* policy rewriting
* system-level changes
* speculative autonomy

---

# 5. Lesson Learned (Archived)

In early development it became clear:

* ungoverned autonomy is unsafe,
* daemons and background loops create instability,
* agents need explicit boundaries,
* audits must be strict and mandatory,
* planning must incorporate domain rules,
* humans must remain involved in constitutional evolution.

These lessons shaped the modern system.

---

# 6. Deprecated Elements (Preserved)

Old drafts referenced concepts no longer in use:

* self-triggering updates,
* autonomous daemons,
* early schema formats,
* loose capability extraction,
* outdated JSON-based manifests,
* detached planning workflows.

These are maintained here only to document the evolution of ideas.

---

# 7. Notes on Historical Context

At the time this draft was written:

* the CLI was incomplete,
* the audit engine did not exist,
* `.intent/` had not been formalized,
* the Knowledge Graph was early and fragile,
* agents lacked alignment with governance.

Thus, most strategic thinking focused on discovering the right shape for the system — which later became the stable architecture used today.

# 8. Summary (Archive)

This document reflects an early exploration of what CORE might become.
Modern CORE is far more concrete, governed, safe, and structured.

For modern planning, refer to:

* `planning/01-complete-implementation-plan.md`
* `core-concept/02_ARCHITECTURE.md`
* `autonomy-and-governance/03-test-generation-pragmatics.md`
