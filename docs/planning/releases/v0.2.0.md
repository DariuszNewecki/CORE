# Release v0.2.0 — Governance Foundation & Autonomous Pipeline

This release marks the first **publicly coherent**, architecturally stable, and constitutionally governed version of CORE.

It delivers the fully functional A1 autonomous development pipeline, the complete governance stack, and the modern directory structure.

---

# 1. Highlights

### ✔ Fully functional autonomous development (A1)

* Crate pipeline: isolated, safe, auditable
* Planner + Coder agents producing real code
* Validation pipeline (Black, Ruff, syntax, tests)
* Complete constitutional audit preventing unsafe integration
* Manual review + acceptance workflow

### ✔ Modern directory architecture

```
src/
├── api/
├── body/
├── features/
├── mind/
├── services/
├── shared/
└── will/
```

### ✔ Governance layer online

* `.intent/` active as constitutional source of truth
* policy loader + resolver stable
* capability domains functional
* audit coverage > 85 checks

### ✔ Knowledge Graph operational

* symbol indexing
* capability extraction
* vectorization service
* drift and similarity analysis

### ✔ CLI coherence

* `core-admin develop feature`
* `core-admin check audit`
* `core-admin fix ...`
* `core-admin manage ...`

All commands reflect the modern architecture.

# 3. Breaking Changes

### ❗ Directory structure changed

Older paths such as `src/core/` or `src/agents/` are no longer valid.

### ❗ Daemon-based experimental flows removed

Autonomous background processing has been replaced by on-demand CLI workflows.

### ❗ Legacy audit code removed

All old checks replaced with the unified governance system.

### ❗ Manifest format updated

Capability and symbol manifests are now unified under `.intent/`.

---

# 4. Migration Guide

### Step 1 — Clean working copy

Remove any old directories:

```
rm -rf src/core src/agents src/legacy
```

### Step 2 — Update dependencies

```bash
poetry install
```

### Step 3 — Sync knowledge

```bash
poetry run core-admin manage database sync-knowledge
```

### Step 4 — Run audit

```bash
poetry run core-admin check audit
```

# 5. New Capabilities

## 5.1. Drift Detection

* identifies outdated symbols
* surfaces inconsistent capability annotations

## 5.2. Similarity Analysis

* finds problematic duplication
* aids refactoring in future A3

## 5.3. Context Builder

* consolidates all inputs for agents
* includes rule bundles
* deterministic and reproducible

---

# 6. Developer Experience Improvements

* meaningful error messages
* structured audit output
* improved CLI help
* simplified test setup

---

# 7. Roadmap After v0.2.0

### Phase 1.5 (Hardening)

* stronger boundaries
* better planner constraints
* improved drift checks

### Phase 2 (Intent-Aware Agents)

* rule-driven planning
* domain-aware generation

### Phase 3 (Governed Refactoring)

* safe automated refactor suggestions
* deeper Knowledge Graph integration

---

# 8. Release Summary

v0.2.0 establishes:

* the first stable, safe autonomous pipeline,
* a fully governed constitution,
* modern architecture,
* solid foundations for future autonomy.

It is the release where CORE becomes a **real autonomous development framework**, not a prototype — and the starting point for its evolution toward A2 and A3.
