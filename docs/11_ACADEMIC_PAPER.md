Title (working):
Constitutional Software Engineering: Mind–Body–Will Governance for AI-Driven Systems

Abstract (draft):
Large Language Models (LLMs) accelerate code generation but amplify architectural drift and erode trust in software evolution. We present Constitutional Software Engineering (CSE), a framework that treats a project’s intent and rules as a first-class, machine-readable Constitution (“Mind”), executed by a constrained Body (code + tools), and governed by a deliberate Will (AI agents) under an independent Constitutional Auditor. We instantiate CSE in CORE, which implements cryptographically signed proposals, quorum rules, and canary self-audits before constitutional changes apply. A staged Autonomy Ladder demonstrates governed progression from self-awareness to self-healing. In a case study, CORE detects capability gaps, proposes compliant fixes, and ratifies them under human-in-the-loop signatures, integrating CI to continuously enforce the Constitution. We find that CSE maintains architectural integrity while enabling safe AI-assisted evolution at scale.

1. Introduction

Problem: AI speeds code, not governance; drift & spaghetti persist.

Thesis: Treat intent & rules as executable artifacts to bound AI agency.

Contributions:

CSE model (Mind–Body–Will + Auditor),

Signed-proposal governance protocol with canary validation,

Autonomy Ladder for governed AI agency,

CORE implementation + evaluable CI pipeline.

(Grounding: architecture & flows)

2. Background & Related Models

Code assistants vs. governed systems; CI/CD vs. constitutional audits.

Why “machine-readable governance” differs from linting/policies.

3. Constitutional Software Engineering (CSE)

Mind: the Constitution (.intent/): principles, policies, schemas, knowledge graph. Define invariants (e.g., every change has declared intent; knowledge graph is current).

Body: deterministic machinery (src/, CLI), audited by rules.

Will: agents bound by policies (reason_from_reality; pre_write_validation).

Auditor: parses code (AST) → builds knowledge graph → enforces.

4. Governance Protocol

Lifecycle: Proposal → Sign → Quorum → Canary → Ratify.

Cryptographic approvals & quorum: approvers.yaml, critical paths.

Canary validation: ephemeral clone + full constitutional audit before apply (algorithm/pseudocode from CLI).

Operational procedures: onboarding, revocation, emergency key compromise.

5. The Autonomy Ladder (Governed Agency)

A0–A? levels mapped to CORE:
A0 Self-awareness (auditor + knowledge graph) →
A1 Governed action (develop under policies) →
A2 Proposal discipline (signed + quorum) →
A3 Self-healing (auto-propose tag/refactor; human ratifies) →
A4 Architect’s cockpit (capability consolidation / abstraction).

Formal properties: each level adds constraints, not unconstrained agency.

6. Implementation: CORE

Directory anatomy & allowed imports; visual pipeline to knowledge graph.

Policies that bind agents; regeneration preconditions.

CI integration (PR comments, nightly fail surfacing).

7. Case Study: From Drift to Ratified Fix

Scenario: knowledge graph shows unassigned capabilities (e.g., parsing helpers). Auditor flags; propose capability tags/refactor; collect signatures; run canary; ratify. Metrics to report: time-to-ratify, audit pass rate, drift delta.

8. Security & Safety Analysis

Key management & signatures (procedures + emergency revocation).

Risk: private key in repo—lessons & hardening (rotate, history purge, enforce secrets scanning; verify .gitignore + CI secret checks).

Dev vs Prod quorum modes; critical paths.

9. Evaluation Plan

Benchmarks: architectural drift incidents/month, MTTR for governance fixes, % of PRs blocked by constitutional audit, ratio of auto-proposed vs. human-drafted proposals, reproducibility via CI artifacts.

10. Limitations & Threats to Validity

Model hallucinations vs. policy enforcement; governance overhead; false positives in audits; portability to non-Python codebases.

11. Future Work

Multi-repo federated constitutions; cross-service policy propagation; formal verification hooks; richer provenance logs.

12. Conclusion

CSE makes AI-accelerated development governable, auditable, and evolvable.
