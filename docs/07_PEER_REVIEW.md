# 7. Constitutional Peer Review

## The Principle: Proactive Self-Improvement

A core principle of CORE is that a system must not only govern itself but also actively seek to improve its own governance. The Constitutional Peer Review feature is the primary mechanism for this proactive self-improvement.

It answers the question: **"Is our constitution the best it can be?"**

This process allows CORE to leverage powerful, external Large Language Models (LLMs) as expert consultants. It can ask for a "second opinion" on its own principles, policies, and structure, identifying gaps, ambiguities, or potential improvements that it might not be able to see on its own.

## The Workflow: A Safe, Human-in-the-Loop Process

The peer review process is designed to be fundamentally safe, keeping the human operator in full control of any resulting changes. The external LLM can only **suggest**; it can never **act**.

### Step 1: Exporting the Constitutional Bundle

The first step is to package the system's entire "Mind" (`.intent/` directory) into a single, portable file that an LLM can analyze.

**Command:**

```bash
poetry run core-admin review export
```

This command reads your `meta.yaml` to discover all constitutional files and bundles them into `reports/constitution_bundle.txt`. This is useful for manual inspection or for sending to different AI models.

### Step 2: Requesting the Peer Review

The main command automates the bundling and review request in a single step.

**Command:**

```bash
poetry run core-admin review peer-review
```

**What this command does:**

* Performs the same **export** process internally to create the constitutional bundle.
* Loads a specialized set of instructions from `.intent/prompts/constitutional_review.prompt`.
* Sends the bundle and the instructions to the Orchestrator LLM configured in your `.env` file.
* Saves the AI's detailed feedback as a Markdown file to `reports/constitutional_review.md`.

### Step 3: Taking Action on the Feedback

The output report is a set of suggestions for the human operator. It is your responsibility to review this feedback and decide what to act on.

* A strong piece of feedback from the review (e.g., *"The policy for secrets management is incomplete"*) should be transformed into a new item on the **Project Roadmap** or a formal **constitutional amendment proposal** (`.intent/proposals/cr-*.yaml`).
* This loop allows CORE to use external intelligence to evolve its own constitution **without ever sacrificing** the safety and control of its human-in-the-loop governance model.
