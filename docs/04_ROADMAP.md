# The CORE Project Roadmap

## For New Users: Where CORE Is Going
CORE is evolving from a system that audits code (**A0**) into a conversational AI architect (**A4**) that builds apps from your ideas.  
The foundational governance layer is complete.

Our roadmap is now focused on two major epics:

- **v1.0: The Self-Evolving Architect** ‚Äì Making the system's AI reasoning smarter and more efficient.  
- **v1.1: The Accessible Operator** ‚Äì Unifying all commands into a single, user-friendly CLI with an interactive menu.

üëâ You can help! Check out the **Next Up** phase in the tables below for great contribution opportunities.

---

## Preamble: From Foundation to Self-Evolution
- The project has a stable foundation for audits and governance.  
- The core logic for the policy-driven AI layer (**Mind/Body/Will**) is implemented.  
- With the completion of the conversational chat command, the system can now translate natural language into structured goals.  
- The next steps focus on making the system's reasoning more dynamic and its user interface more accessible.

## Epic v1.0: The Self-Evolving Architect

**Goal:** Build a self-evolving system that understands non-coders‚Äô ideas and optimizes AI usage without hardcoded limits.

### Roadmap Phases (v1.0)

| Phase | Challenge | Goal | Status | Opportunity | ETA |
|-------|-----------|------|--------|-------------|-----|
| 1: Constitution | Implicit AI roles in code | Define `cognitive_roles.yaml` for roles like Planner, Coder | ‚úÖ Completed | Refine roles or propose new specialized agents (e.g., TestWriter). | Completed Q3 2024 |
| 2: Machinery | Body has AI logic | Build simple `CognitiveService` to read roles | ‚úÖ Completed | Optimize the `CognitiveService` for performance or caching. | Completed Q3 2024 |
| 3: Agents | Agents use hardcoded clients | Refactor agents to use `CognitiveService` | ‚úÖ Completed | Improve the agent reasoning loop in `run_development_cycle`. | Completed Q3 2024 |
| 4: Cleanup | Obsolete classes | Remove old `BaseLLMClient`; update `runtime_requirements.yaml` | ‚è≥ Planned | Great first-time contributor task: remove `src/core/clients.py`. | Q4 2024 |
| 5: Conversational Access | CLI limits non-coders | Add `IntentTranslator` agent and `core-admin chat` command | ‚úÖ Completed | Improve `intent_translator.prompt` for more complex queries. | Completed Q3 2024 |
| 6: Dynamic Deduction | Static LLM assignments | Add `DeductionAgent` + policy to optimize LLM choices | ‚úÖ Completed | Refine `deduction_policy.yaml` scoring weights for different tasks. | Completed Q3 2024 |

## Epic v1.1: The Accessible Operator

**Goal:** Dramatically improve the accessibility and discoverability of CORE's capabilities by unifying all user actions into a single `core-admin` entrypoint with an optional interactive menu.

### Roadmap Phases (v1.1)

| Phase | Challenge | Goal | Status | Opportunity | ETA |
|-------|-----------|------|--------|-------------|-----|
| 1: Consolidation | Multiple entry points (`make`, `poetry run`) | Migrate all Makefile logic into scriptable `core-admin system` commands | ‚úÖ Completed | Help document the new `core-admin system` commands. | Completed Q3 2024 |
| 2: Discoverability | Poor command visibility | Implement a richly formatted, grouped help screen for `core-admin --help` | ‚è≥ Planned | Design the layout and grouping for the new help text. | Q2 2025 |
| 3: Accessibility | High cognitive load for new users | Build an interactive, menu-driven TUI that launches on `core-admin` | ‚úÖ Completed | Suggest improvements to the menu flow or wording in `interactive.py`. | Completed Q3 2024 |
| 4: API Clarity | Undefined API purpose | Create `docs/10_API_REFERENCE.md` to formalize the API for machine use | ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Next Up | Great documentation task for a beginner. | Q1 2025 |

---

## Epic v1.2: The Governed Capability System (New Initiative)

**Goal:** Address significant architectural debt by migrating the monolithic `capability_tags.yaml` to a decentralized, domain-driven system.  
This will improve scalability, reduce developer friction, and enable more robust governance.

### Roadmap Phases (v1.2)

| Phase | Challenge | Goal | Status | Opportunity | ETA |
|-------|-----------|------|--------|-------------|-----|
| 1: Discovery | Single point of failure | Analyze existing tags and design the new decentralized schema | ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Next Up | Help define the new schema in `docs/migrations/MIGRATION_GUIDE_CAPABILITY_TAGS.md`. | Q1 2025 |
| 2: Migration | Risk of breaking changes | Implement a dual-format loader and migrate capabilities domain by domain | ‚è≥ Planned | Contribute by migrating a specific domain (e.g., core or agents). | Q2 2025 |
| 3: Finalization | Legacy code | Deprecate the old monolithic file and update all tools to use the new system | ‚è≥ Planned | Help find and replace legacy usages of the old system. | Q2 2025 |

üìÑ Full Plan: `docs/migrations/MIGRATION_GUIDE_CAPABILITY_TAGS.md`

## Future Phases (Post-v1.1)

| Phase | Goal | ETA |
|-------|------|-----|
| Web Interface & DB | Evolve the unified CLI/API to a web UI with DB backing for full accessibility | Q3 2025 |

## Historical Roadmap (v0.2.0, Completed)

- ‚úÖ Scaling Constitution  
- ‚úÖ Autonomous MVP  
- ‚úÖ Self-Improvement  
- ‚úÖ Robustness  
- ‚úÖ Architectural Health  

---

## Takeaways
- A new architectural epic (**v1.2**) has been added to refactor the capability system. This is now a **top priority**.  
- The major AI reasoning work from the **v1.0** epic is complete.  
- The next major user-facing task remains **Phase 1.1.4: API Clarity**.  
- The project is on track for a **v1.1 release in Q1 2025**.  

---

## Contribute
- **Architecture enthusiasts:** Review and contribute to Phase **1.2.1: Discovery** plan.  
- **Developer experience:** Documentation task in Phase **1.1.4** is a perfect first issue.  
- **Beginners:** Phase **1.0.4: Cleanup** is a great, well-defined first issue to tackle.
