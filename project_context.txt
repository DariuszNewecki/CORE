# Contributing to CORE

First off, thank you for considering a contribution. CORE is an ambitious project exploring a new frontier of self-governing software, and every contribution — from a simple bug report to a deep philosophical discussion — is incredibly valuable.

This document provides a guide for how you can get involved.

## The Philosophy: Principled Contributions

CORE is a system governed by a constitution. We ask that all contributions align with the principles laid out in our foundational documents. Before diving into code, we highly recommend reading:

1.  **[The CORE Philosophy (`docs/01_PHILOSOPHY.md`)](docs/01_PHILOSOPHY.md)** — to understand the *why* behind the project.
2.  **[The System Architecture (`docs/02_ARCHITECTURE.md`)](docs/02_ARCHITECTURE.md)** — to understand the *how* of the Mind/Body separation.

The most important principle for contributors is `clarity_first`. Every change should make the system easier to understand, not harder.

## How You Can Contribute

There are many ways to contribute, and many of them don't involve writing a single line of code.

### 🏛️ Discussing Architecture and Governance

The most valuable contributions at this early stage are discussions about the core architecture and governance model.

-   **Review our Roadmap:** Read our **[Strategic Plan (`docs/04_ROADMAP.md`)](docs/04_ROADMAP.md)**.
-   **Open an Issue:** Find a challenge on the roadmap that interests you (e.g., “Scalability of the Manifest”) and open an issue to discuss our proposed approach or suggest a new one.

### 🐞 Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug or a constitutional inconsistency, please open an issue. A great bug report includes:
-   The command you ran.
-   The full output, including the error and traceback.
-   Your analysis of why you think it's happening.

Our goal is for the system’s `ConstitutionalAuditor` to catch all inconsistencies, but if you find one it missed, you’ve found a valuable way to make our immune system stronger!

### ✍️ Improving Documentation

If you find a part of our documentation confusing, unclear, or incomplete, a pull request to improve it is a massive contribution. Clear documentation is vital for the project's health.

### 💻 Contributing Code

If you'd like to contribute code, please follow these steps:

1.  Find an open issue that you'd like to work on (or open a new one for discussion).
2.  Fork the repository and create a new branch.
3.  **Write the code.** Ensure your code includes docstrings and type hints.
4.  **Run the checks.** Before submitting, please run the full introspection cycle to ensure your changes are constitutionally valid:
    ```bash
    # Install dependencies
    poetry install
    # Run the full self-audit
    python -m src.core.capabilities
    ```
5.  Submit a pull request.

# 1. The CORE Philosophy

## Prime Directive

**CORE exists to transform human intent into complete, evolving software systems — without drift, duplication, or degradation.**

It does not merely generate code; it **governs**, **learns**, and **rewrites** itself under the authority of an explicit, machine-readable constitution. It is a system designed to build other systems, safely and transparently.

## The CORE Belief System

Our architecture is founded on a set of core beliefs about the future of software development:

1.  **Intent, Not Instructions:** Software development should be about declaring a desired outcome (`intent`), not writing a list of procedural steps (`instructions`).
2.  **Governance is a Feature:** In a world of autonomous AI agents, safety, alignment, and auditability are not afterthoughts—they are the primary features of a trustworthy system.
3.  **Code is a Liability:** All code must justify its existence. It must be traceable to a declared purpose, validated against constitutional principles, and be as simple as possible. Unnecessary or un-auditable code is a source of risk.
4.  **A System Must Know Itself:** To evolve safely, a system must have a deep and accurate understanding of its own structure, capabilities, and rules. Self-awareness (`introspection`) is the prerequisite for self-improvement.

## The Ten-Phase Loop of Reasoned Action

All autonomous actions in CORE are governed by a ten-phase loop. This structure ensures that every action is deliberate, justified, and validated. It prevents the system from taking impulsive or un-auditable shortcuts.

The phases are:

1.  **GOAL:** A high-level objective is received from a human operator.
    *(e.g., "Add cryptographic signing to the approval process.")*

2.  **WHY:** The system links the goal to a core constitutional principle.
    *(e.g., "This serves the `safe_by_default` principle.")*

3.  **INTENT:** The goal and its justification are formalized into a clear, machine-readable intent.
    *(e.g., Formalize the request into a plan to modify the `core-admin` tool.)*

4.  **AGENT:** The system selects the appropriate agent(s) for the task.
    *(e.g., The `PlannerAgent` is assigned.)*

5.  **MEANS:** The agent consults its capabilities and knowledge to determine *how* it can achieve the intent.
    *(e.g., The agent knows it has `code_generation` and `introspection` capabilities.)*

6.  **PLAN:** The agent produces a detailed, step-by-step, auditable plan.
    *(e.g., 1. Add `cryptography` library. 2. Add `keygen` function. 3. Modify `approve` function...)*

7.  **ACTION:** The system executes the plan, one validated step at a time.
    *(e.g., The `GeneratorAgent` writes new code to files.)*

8.  **FEEDBACK:** The system's "immune system" (`ConstitutionalAuditor`, `pytest`, linters) provides feedback on the action.
    *(e.g., "The new code fails a linting check." or "All tests pass.")*

9.  **ADAPTATION:** The system uses the feedback to self-correct or confirm the change.
    *(e.g., The `SelfCorrectionEngine` fixes the linting error, or `GitService` commits the successful change.)*

10. **EVOLUTION:** The system updates its self-image (`KnowledgeGraph`) to reflect its new state, completing the loop.

This loop ensures that CORE does not simply act, but *reasons*. Every change is a deliberate, auditable, and constitutionally-aligned evolution.

# 2. The CORE Architecture

## The Mind-Body Problem, Solved

The central architectural pattern in CORE is a strict separation between the system's "Mind" and its "Body."

-   **The Mind (`.intent/`):** A declarative, version-controlled, and human-readable collection of files that represents the system's complete self-knowledge, purpose, and rules. It is the single source of truth for what the system *is* and *should be*.
-   **The Body (`src/`):** An imperative, executable collection of Python modules that acts upon the world. Its sole purpose is to carry out the will of the Mind, and its every action is governed by the rules declared within the Mind.

This separation is not just a convention; it is a constitutional law enforced by the system itself. The `ConstitutionalAuditor` is the bridge between the two, constantly ensuring the Body is in perfect alignment with the Mind.

## The Anatomy of the Mind (`.intent/`)

The `.intent/` directory is structured to provide a complete and transparent view of the system's governance.

| Directory | Purpose | Key Files |
|---|---|---|
| **`/mission`** | **The Constitution's Soul:** High-level, philosophical principles. | `principles.yaml`, `northstar.yaml` |
| **`/policies`** | **The Constitution's Laws:** Specific, machine-readable rules that govern agent behavior. | `safety_policies.yaml`, `intent_guard.yaml` |
| **`/knowledge`** | **The System's Self-Image:** Declarative knowledge about the system's own structure. | `knowledge_graph.json`, `source_structure.yaml` |
| **`/constitution`** | **The Machinery of Governance:** Defines the human operators and processes for changing the constitution. | `approvers.pub` |
| **`/proposals`** | **The Legislative Floor:** A safe, temporary "sandbox" for drafting and signing proposed constitutional changes. | `cr-*.yaml` |
| **`/config`** | **Environmental Awareness:** Declares the system's dependencies on its runtime environment. | `runtime_requirements.yaml` |
| **`/schemas`** | **The Blueprint:** JSON schemas that define the structure of the knowledge files. | `knowledge_graph_entry.schema.json` |

## The Anatomy of the Body (`src/`)

The `src/` directory is organized into strict architectural **domains**. These domains are defined in `.intent/knowledge/source_structure.yaml`, and cross-domain communication is tightly controlled by rules enforced by the `ConstitutionalAuditor`.

| Directory | Domain | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| **`/core`** | `core` | The central nervous system. Handles the main application loop, API, and core services like file handling and Git integration. |
| **`/agents`** | `agents` | The specialized AI actors. Contains the `PlannerAgent` and its related models and utilities. |
| **`/system`** | `system` | The machinery of self-governance. Contains the `ConstitutionalAuditor`, `core-admin` CLI, and introspection tools. |
| **`/shared`** | `shared` | The common library. Provides shared utilities like logging and configuration loading that are accessible by all other domains. |

## The Flow of Knowledge: From Code to Graph

The system's self-awareness is not magic; it is the result of a deliberate introspection process.

1.  **Code Annotation:** Developers (human or AI) annotate functions and classes with `# CAPABILITY:` tags to declare their purpose.
2.  **Introspection (`KnowledgeGraphBuilder`):** A dedicated tool (`codegraph_builder.py`) runs, scanning the entire `src/` directory. It uses Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) analysis to parse every file.
3.  **Knowledge Graph Creation:** It builds a comprehensive JSON file, `knowledge_graph.json`, which is a detailed map of every function, class, capability, and relationship in the codebase.
4.  **Constitutional Audit:** The `ConstitutionalAuditor` then uses this freshly generated Knowledge Graph as its primary source of truth to verify that the system's reality (the code) matches its declared intent (the constitution).

This loop—**Code → Introspect → Govern**—is fundamental to CORE's ability to evolve safely.

# 3. The CORE Governance Model

CORE's ability to evolve its own constitution is its most powerful and most dangerous capability. To ensure this process is safe, auditable, and aligned with human intent, it is governed by a strict, multi-stage **Constitutional Amendment Process**.

This process is designed to solve the central paradox of self-modification: **how can a system safely approve a change that might break its own ability to approve changes?**

## The Guiding Principle: The Canary Check

The entire process is built around a single, foolproof safety mechanism: the **"Canary" Check**.

Before any change is applied to the live constitution, the system performs a "what-if" simulation. It creates a temporary, isolated copy of itself in memory, applies the proposed change to this "canary," and then commands the canary to run a full self-audit.

-   If the canary, operating under the new proposed rules, reports a perfect, error-free audit, the change is deemed safe and is automatically applied to the live system.
-   If the canary's audit fails, it proves the change would create a broken or inconsistent state. The proposal is automatically rejected, and the live system is never touched.

This mechanism ensures that CORE can never approve an amendment that would render it unable to govern itself.

## The Life of a Constitutional Amendment

A change to any file within the `.intent/` directory follows a formal, five-step lifecycle.

### Step 1: Proposal (`.intent/proposals/`)

An AI agent or a human developer determines that a constitutional change is needed. They do not edit the target file directly. Instead, they create a formal **proposal file** in the `.intent/proposals/` directory.

This proposal is a YAML file containing:
-   `target_path`: The file to be changed.
-   `justification`: A human-readable reason for the change.
-   `content`: The full proposed new content of the file.

### Step 2: Signing (`core-admin proposals-sign`)

Constitutional changes require formal, cryptographic proof of human intent. A human operator uses the `core-admin` tool to sign the proposal with their private key.

```bash
# Generate a personal key pair (one-time setup)
core-admin keygen "your.name@example.com"

# Sign a pending proposal
core-admin proposals-sign cr-new-capability.yaml
```
This action adds a verifiable signature to the proposal file.

### Step 3: Quorum Verification

The system checks .intent/constitution/approvers.pub to determine how many signatures are required (the "quorum").
Standard changes (like adding a capability) might require only one signature.
Critical changes (like modifying the approver list itself) require a higher quorum, such as two or more signatures.

### Step 4: Approval & The Canary Check (core-admin proposals-approve)

Once a proposal has a sufficient number of valid signatures, any authorized operator can initiate the final approval.
```bash
core-admin proposals-approve cr-new-capability.yaml
```

This command triggers the automated canary check. The operator watches the log as the system simulates the change and runs its self-audit.

### Step 5: Ratification

If the canary check passes, the change is automatically applied to the live .intent/ directory. The original proposal file is deleted, and the system now operates under its new, evolved constitution. The entire transaction is recorded in an auditable history log.
This rigorous process ensures that every change to CORE's "mind" is deliberate, secure, and verifiably safe.

# 4. The CORE Project Roadmap

## Preamble: From Foundation to Future

The initial development of CORE focused on building a stable, self-aware, and constitutionally governed foundation. The major phases of this foundational work are now complete:

-   ✅ **A Unified "Mind":** The system's self-knowledge has been consolidated into a single, verifiable Knowledge Graph.
-   ✅ **A Unified Governance Engine:** The `ConstitutionalAuditor` is now the single, dynamic engine for enforcing all constitutional principles.
-   ✅ **Constitutional Compliance:** The system now passes its own strict self-audit with zero errors, proving its internal consistency.
-   ✅ **A Secure Amendment Process:** A robust, human-in-the-loop, cryptographically signed process for evolving the system's own constitution has been implemented and verified.

With this stable and secure foundation in place, the project is now moving into its next major phase: **enabling true autonomous application development.**

The following sections outline the key architectural challenges and features on our roadmap. We welcome discussion and contributions on these topics.

---

## Phase 1: Scaling the Constitution

As identified in our external architectural reviews, the current constitutional structure, while sound, faces several scalability challenges. Our next priority is to evolve the `.intent/` directory to support a system that can manage hundreds or thousands of files.

### 1.1: Implement Modular Manifests

-   **Challenge:** The current `project_manifest.yaml` is monolithic. At scale, this becomes a bottleneck and a single point of failure.
-   **Goal:** Refactor the system to support **domain-specific manifests** (e.g., `src/agents/manifest.yaml`). A master process will aggregate these into a global view, but day-to-day management will become modular.
-   **Status:** ⏳ **Not Started**

### 1.2: Implement Hierarchical Capabilities

-   **Challenge:** The current `capability_tags.yaml` is a flat list. This will become unmanageable as the system's skills grow.
-   **Goal:** Evolve the capability system to support **namespacing and hierarchy**. This will allow for a more organized and expressive taxonomy of actions (e.g., `data.storage.write`, `ui.render.table`).
-   **Status:** ⏳ **Not Started**

### 1.3: Implement Hierarchical Domains

-   **Challenge:** The architectural domains in `source_structure.yaml` are flat. Real-world applications require nested and layered architectures.
-   **Goal:** Evolve the domain model to support **parent-child relationships**, allowing domains to inherit permissions and creating a true architectural tree.
-   **Status:** ⏳ **Not Started**

---

## Phase 2: Enhancing Agent Reasoning

The next step is to make the system's AI agents smarter and safer in how they interpret and act upon the constitution.

### 2.1: Implement a Precedence of Principles

-   **Challenge:** AI agents lack the intuition to resolve conflicts between high-level principles (e.g., `clarity_first` vs. `safe_by_default`).
-   **Goal:** Create a new constitutional file that defines a **clear hierarchy or weighting system** for principles. This will provide agents with a deterministic framework for making decisions when rules conflict.
-   **Status:** ⏳ **Not Started**

### 2.2: Enforce Auditable Justification Logs

-   **Challenge:** An agent's "reasoning" for a particular plan can be opaque.
-   **Goal:** Modify the `PlannerAgent` to require that every generated plan includes a **`justification` block**. This block will explicitly state which constitutional principle the plan serves and provide a brief, human-readable explanation of the agent's reasoning. This log will become a critical part of the audit trail.
-   **Status:** ⏳ **Not Started**

---

## Phase 3: Autonomous Application Generation

This is the ultimate goal of the CORE project. With a scalable constitution and smarter agents, we will build the capabilities for CORE to generate and manage new software projects from a high-level intent.

-   **Goal:** Develop the end-to-end flow where a user can provide a prompt like, "Build a simple web app to track my book collection," and have CORE:
    1.  Propose a new constitutional structure for the book app.
    2.  Generate the initial code, including models, API endpoints, and basic UI.
    3.  Continuously run its self-audit against the new application.
    4.  Accept further intents to evolve the new application.
-   **Status:** ⏳ **Not Started**

We believe that by solving the challenges in Phase 1 and 2, we will have built a foundation of trust and scalability that makes Phase 3 possible.

# Bring Your Own Repo (Including CORE)

**Principle: Ingestion Isomorphism.** CORE applies the same “attach → audit → propose → canary → ratify” pipeline to any repository — including CORE itself.

## Modes
- **Overlay mode** (no `.intent/` present): propose a minimal `.intent/` scaffold, capability tags, docstrings. No direct writes.
- **Respect & Critique mode** (`.intent/` present): use the repo’s own constitution, run audit, generate proposals with human-readable narratives.

## Safety
- Operates on a temporary copy; live repo is only updated via approved proposals.
- Canary must pass under the target repo’s own rules before any change applies.
- Idempotence: re-ingesting a clean repo yields zero deltas.

## Outputs
- **Intent narrative:** what this repo appears to do, where intent is unclear.
- **Governance diff:** gaps in policies/structure and minimal proposals.
- **Plan preview:** step sequence with pre/postconditions and proofs (tests, audit deltas).

## Acceptance Criteria
1) Self-ingest CORE (read-only): coherent narrative, no blocking proposals.
2) Self-ingest CORE (propose): only optional improvements; canary passes.
3) Double-run idempotence: second run produces no new proposals.
4) Foreign repo without `.intent/`: emits overlay proposals only.
5) Foreign repo with `.intent/`: respects its constitution/quorum/critical paths.

# CORE North Star

**Goal:** Turn high-level goals into governed, safe, running software — autonomously.

**Invariant:** Safety never degrades. Every change is proven aligned to intent before it lands (policies, tests, canary audit).

## The Autonomy Ladder

- **A0 · Observe** — Attach to any repo, build knowledge graph, run auditor (read-only).
- **A1 · Propose** — Open PRs with small, safe fixes (docstrings, capability tags, logging). Human merges.
- **A2 · Governed Writes** — Canary-validated changes self-apply with policy (human optional by risk tier).
- **A3 · BYOR** — CORE-fy arbitrary repos (including CORE), propose structure, capabilities, tests.
- **A4 · Birth New Apps** — From a goal, scaffold feature-first app (Mind/Body), tests, CI/CD.
- **A5 · Continuous Intent Dev** — Roadmap evolves in natural language; CORE plans, implements, releases within risk budgets.

## Guardrails
- **Risk tiers:** auto-merge only for low-risk scopes at first.
- **Evidence gates:** static policies + tests + canary must pass.
- **Idempotence:** ingestion produces stable results; re-runs don’t thrash.
- **Kill switch:** rollback on anomaly/error-budget breach.

## KPIs
- Auditor errors/warnings → sustained zero
- % code with capability tags
- Proposal acceptance rate / MTTR
- % PRs generated by CORE
- % no-human releases by risk tier
- Post-merge incident rate

## Current Status
- Project status: **Architectural Prototype**.
- Targeting **M1 (A0→A1)**: CORE overlay, CI audit, auto-PRs for docstrings/tags/logging.

# Project CORE: A Strategic Plan for Refactoring and Evolution

## 1. Preamble: From Diagnosis to Vision

This document outlines the strategic plan to evolve the CORE system from its current state to a truly self-governing, resilient, and evolvable architecture.

The initial feeling of "running in circles" was a correct diagnosis of a system struggling with internal inconsistencies. The recent comprehensive audit, while displaying numerous errors and warnings, was not a sign of failure. It was the **first successful act of self-diagnosis** by the system's nascent "brain." The audit provided a clear, actionable roadmap, revealing a fundamental disconnect between the declared `intent` and the `source code` reality.

This plan details the two major phases of our work:
*   **Part A: Foundational Refactoring.** To achieve a stable, constitutionally compliant baseline by fixing the issues diagnosed by the audit.
*   **Part B: Enabling True Self-Governance.** To build the necessary mechanisms for the system to evolve its own code and constitution safely and autonomously.

---

## Part A: Foundational Refactoring (Achieving Stability)

This phase focuses on acting on the audit's results to create a clean, consistent, and understandable codebase. It is the work required to teach the system what a "good" state looks like.

### Step A1: Unify the "Brain"
*   **Goal:** Eliminate data redundancy and create a single source of truth for the system's knowledge of its own code.
*   **Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**
*   **Outcome:** The dual `codegraph.json` and `function_manifest.json` files have been replaced by a single, comprehensive `.intent/knowledge/knowledge_graph.json`. The `KnowledgeGraphBuilder` tool is now the sole producer of this artifact.

### Step A2: Consolidate Governance
*   **Goal:** Eliminate redundant tools and establish a single, authoritative script for verifying the system's integrity.
*   **Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**
*   **Outcome:** The `ConstitutionalAuditor` is now the master tool for all static analysis. Older, fragmented tools (`architectural_auditor`, `principle_validator`, etc.) have been merged into it or deleted.

### Step A3: Stabilize the System
*   **Goal:** Ensure the system has a reliable safety net for development.
*   **Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**
*   **Outcome:** The test suite has been repaired. Obsolete tests were deleted, and configuration issues (`pythonpath`, dependency conflicts) were resolved, resulting in a stable and passing test run.

### Step A4: Achieve Constitutional Compliance
*   **Goal:** Resolve all critical errors reported by the `ConstitutionalAuditor`.
*   **Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**
*   **Outcome:** All structural errors (domain mismatches, illegal imports) have been fixed. The "mind-body problem" has been solved by manually annotating the existing codebase with `# CAPABILITY:` tags, fully aligning the `project_manifest.yaml` with the implementation. The audit now reports **ZERO critical errors.**

---

## Part B: The Path Forward (Enabling Evolution)

With a stable foundation, we can now build the mechanisms that allow CORE to fulfill its prime directive: to evolve itself safely.

### Step B1: Trust the Brain (Simplification & Cleanup)

*   **Goal:** Eliminate all audit warnings by making the system's "brain" more intelligent.
*   **Guiding Principle:** We did not blindly patch the auditor. Instead, we enhanced the `KnowledgeGraphBuilder` so it could understand more complex, valid code patterns, thus resolving the root cause of the false warnings.
*   **Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**
*   **Outcome:** The `KnowledgeGraphBuilder` has been upgraded with a context-aware AST visitor and a declarative pattern-matching engine (`.intent/knowledge/entry_point_patterns.yaml`). It now correctly identifies inheritance, framework callbacks, and CLI entry points. All schema violations were corrected, and all code was fully documented. The `ConstitutionalAuditor` now reports **ZERO errors and ZERO warnings.**

### Step B2: Build the Immune System (Governed Creation)

*   **Goal:** Evolve the `PlannerAgent` to ensure that all *newly generated* code is automatically compliant with the constitution, preventing future errors.
*   **Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**
*   **Outcome:** The `PlannerAgent._execute_task` method now follows a complete `Generate -> Govern -> Validate -> Self-Correct -> Write` loop. It automatically adds capability tags, enforces docstrings, validates the code, and triggers a self-correction cycle on any validation failure, ensuring only constitutionally compliant code is ever written to disk.

### Step B3: The Constitutional Amendment Process

*   **Goal:** Transform `.intent/` from a "notepad" into a true constitution with a formal, safe amendment process. This allows CORE to evolve its own brain.
*   **Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**
*   **The Mechanism:**
    1.  **The Waiting Room (`.intent/proposals/`):** A dedicated directory for drafting changes to the constitution. Files here are not active.
    2.  **The Proposal Bundle:** A standardized YAML format for change requests (e.g., `cr-....yaml`) containing the `target_path`, `action`, `justification`, and proposed `content`.
    3.  **The Governance Layer:**
        *   **`IntentGuard`:** Enforces a new, critical rule: **No direct writes are allowed into `.intent/` except to the `proposals/` directory.**
        *   **`ConstitutionalAuditor`:** Scans `proposals/`, validates the format of any pending proposals, and reports them in a new "Pending Amendments" section of its report.
    4.  **The Ratification Mechanism (`core-admin` tool):** A human operator uses a simple CLI tool to manage the amendment lifecycle. The key command is `approve`.
    5.  **The "Canary" Pre-flight Check:** The `core-admin approve` command is designed to be fundamentally safe and solves the "how does it know it's broken if it's broken?" paradox.
        *   It spawns a **temporary, isolated "canary" instance** of CORE with the proposed change applied *in memory*.
        *   It commands this canary instance to run a full self-audit.
        *   If the canary audit succeeds, the change is permanently applied to the real `.intent/` directory.
        *   If the canary audit fails, the change is rejected, and the real `.intent/` directory is never touched, preventing system failure.

## 2. Conclusion

Upon completion of this plan, CORE will have evolved from a promising but inconsistent prototype into a robust, self-aware system. It will possess a stable foundation, a clear understanding of its own structure, and—most importantly—a safe, governed process for both creating code and evolving its own foundational intent.

This plan transforms CORE from a system that is merely *audited* to one that is truly *governed*.

# The CORE Constitution

## Section 1: Prime Directive

CORE exists to transform spoken human intent into complete, evolving software systems — without drift, duplication, or degradation.

It does not merely generate code; it **governs**, **learns**, and **rewrites** itself under explicit intent and structural boundaries.

---

## Section 2: Purpose of This Document

This document defines the **philosophy**, **intent flow**, and **operating principles** of CORE. It is not executable logic, nor a manifest — but the **human-facing contract** that justifies and explains all governance mechanisms.

All rules enforced by `.intent/` are *derived* from what is explained here.

## Summary
<!-- What does this change do? -->

## Checks
- [ ] I ran `poetry install && poetry run python -m src.core.capabilities` and it passed.
- [ ] I ran `poetry run ruff check .` and `poetry run black --check .`.
- [ ] I ran `poetry run pytest -q`.

## Governance
- [ ] If I changed `.intent/*`, I used a proposal (`.intent/proposals/cr-*.yaml`) that validates against `proposal.schema.json`.

# CORE Manifesto

CORE is not a framework. It is not a plugin system.  
CORE is a system that evolves itself — governed by explicit declarations of purpose, constraints, and structure.

---

### Beliefs

- Software is never done, but it must always be explainable.
- Changes must serve a declared intent — or challenge it explicitly.
- LLMs are powerful, but must be contained by purpose, not left to guess.
- Governance is not bureaucracy; it’s alignment between vision and action.

---

### CORE exists to:

- Understand its own capabilities
- Apply changes safely and transparently
- Validate every change against declared rules
- Learn from its outcomes and improve
- Inspire new systems to govern themselves

---

CORE does not pretend to be perfect.  
But it refuses to be mindless.

# .intent/mission/northstar.yaml

# PURPOSE: This fulfills evolvable_structure and defines CORE's NorthStar.
name: CORE
version: v0.1.0
purpose: >
  CORE is a self-improving, intent-aware development system.
  Its purpose is to orchestrate safe, meaningful, and governed changes
  to its own codebase and related artifacts through intent bundles and introspective loops.

scope:
  - Planning and decomposition of tasks
  - Code generation via LLMs
  - Change validation and governance enforcement
  - Self-introspection and structural analysis
  - Knowledge management via manifests and graphs
  - Continuous self-evaluation and auditability

values:
  - Clarity over cleverness
  - Safety before speed
  - Traceability of every action
  - Alignment with declared purpose
  - Capability-driven reasoning

notes:
  - CORE evolves iteratively, but never silently.
  - All changes must fulfill a declared intent or generate a proposal to revise that intent.

#
# CORE's Constitution: clear, enforceable, and readable by humans and LLMs.
# Any agent (including future LLMs) must understand and obey these rules.

principles:

  - id: clarity_first
    description: >
      Every function must have:
        - A docstring explaining purpose
        - Clear parameter and return types
        - No nested logic deeper than 3 levels
      If a human cannot understand it in 30 seconds, it must be simplified.

  - id: safe_by_default
    description: >
      Every change must assume rollback or rejection unless explicitly validated.
      No file write, code execution, or intent update may proceed without confirmation.
      Rollback must be possible at every stage.

  - id: reason_with_purpose
    description: >
      Every planning step must include a comment:
        "PURPOSE: This fulfills <principle> from NorthStar."
      Example: "PURPOSE: This fulfills evolvable_structure."
      Actions without purpose tracing are invalid.

  - id: evolvable_structure
    description: >
      CORE may modify its own manifests only if:
        - The change is proposed via IntentBundle
        - It passes all policy checks
        - It is logged with a migration plan
      Self-modification without governance is forbidden.

  - id: no_orphaned_logic
    description: >
      No function, file, or rule may exist without a corresponding entry in the manifest.
      All code must be discoverable and auditable.
      If it's not in function_manifest.json, it does not exist.

  - id: use_intent_bundle
    description: >
      All executable capabilities must be declared and executed via a structured IntentBundle
      that reflects the 10-phase universal reasoning flow.
      No phase may be skipped.
    required_for:
      - all capabilities
      - all autonomous agents
      - all planning functions

  - id: minimalism_over_completeness
    description: >
      Prefer small, focused changes. Do not generate stubs, placeholders, or unused functions.
      If a capability is not actively used or tested, it must be removed.
      Empty implementations are technical debt.

  - id: dry_by_design
    description: >
      No logic may be duplicated. If a function, pattern, or decision exists in one place,
      it must be reused — not rewritten — anywhere else in the system.
      CORE must detect and reject duplication during self-modification.

  - id: single_source_of_truth
    description: >
      The project_manifest.yaml is the single source of truth for all capabilities, structure, and intent.
      All other files (e.g. codegraph.json, function_manifest.json) must be derived from it.
      Manual edits to derived files will be rejected.

  - id: separation_of_concerns
    description: >
      Each domain has a single responsibility:
        - core: orchestration, routing, safety
        - features: capabilities and extensions
        - system/tools: audit, manifest update, introspection
        - clients: external API interaction
      No file may mix logic across domains.
      Violations must be flagged during structural audits.

  - id: predictable_side_effects
    description: >
      Any file change must:
        - Be preceded by a log entry: "CHANGE: <description> — IntentBundle ID: <id>"
        - Be staged via FileHandler (not direct write)
        - Be reversible via Git diff or undo log
      Silent or unlogged changes are forbidden.

  - id: immutable_constitution
    description: >

# CORE — The Self-Improving System Architect

> **Where Intelligence Lives.**

[![Status: Architectural Prototype](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-architectural%20prototype-blue.svg)](#-project-status)
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE)

CORE is a self-governing, constitutionally aligned AI development framework that can plan, write, validate, and evolve software systems — autonomously and safely. It is designed for environments where **trust, traceability, and governance matter**.

---

## 🏛️ Project Status: Architectural Prototype

The core self-governance and constitutional amendment loop is complete and stable. The system can audit and modify its own constitution via a human-in-the-loop, cryptographically signed approval process.

The next phase, as outlined in our **[Strategic Plan](docs/StrategicPlan.md)**, is to expand agent capabilities so CORE can generate and manage entirely new applications based on user intent.

We’re making the project public now to invite collaboration on this foundational architecture.

---

## 🧠 What CORE *is*

* 🧾 Evolves itself through **declared intent**, not hidden assumptions
* 🛡️ Enforces **constitutional rules**, **domain boundaries**, and **safety policies**
* 🧩 Uses a modular agent architecture with a clear separation of concerns
* 📚 Ensures every decision is **documented, reversible, and introspectable**

---

## 🦮 Key Concepts

| Concept                     | Description                                                                              |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`.intent/`**              | The “mind” of CORE: constitution, policies, capability maps, and self-knowledge.         |
| **`ConstitutionalAuditor`** | The “immune system,” continuously verifying code aligns with the constitution.           |
| **`PlannerAgent`**          | Decomposes high-level goals into executable plans.                                       |
| **`core-admin` CLI**        | Human-in-the-loop tool for signing and ratifying constitutional changes.                 |
| **Canary Check**            | Applies proposed changes to an isolated copy and runs a full self-audit before approval. |
| **Knowledge Graph**         | Machine-readable map of symbols, roles, capabilities, and relationships.                 |
| **Git & Rollback**          | Everything is versioned; invalid changes can be safely rolled back.                      |

* Python **3.9+**
* [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency & venv management
* Optional: `ruff`, `black` (installed via Poetry), `uvicorn` for the API server

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/core.git
   cd core
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

3. **Set up your environment**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys/URLs. See .intent/config/runtime_requirements.yaml for required variables.
   ```

4. **Run the self-audit**
   Verify your local setup is constitutionally valid:

   ```bash
   poetry run python -m src.core.capabilities
   ```

   You should see: `✅ ALL CHECKS PASSED (0 warnings)`.

5. **Launch the server (optional)**

   ```bash
   make run
   # FastAPI docs at: http://localhost:8000/docs
   ```

---

## 🔪 What CORE *does*

* Plans improvements using AI agents
* Generates code, tests, and docstrings
* **Self-audits** to ensure constitutional alignment
* **Governs self-modification** via signed proposals + canary checks
* Self-corrects when validation fails
* Logs every step for transparency

---

### 🌌 North Star

CORE’s long-term aim is **A5 autonomy**: turn goals into governed code and running systems, safely and without human intervention in low-risk areas.
See **[NORTH\_STAR](docs/NORTH_STAR.md)** and **[BYOR](docs/05_BYOR.md)** for the roadmap and how CORE applies the same rules to any repo — including itself.

> **Note:** If those docs aren’t in the repo yet, they’re coming soon with the “Ingestion Isomorphism” design.

---

## 🧑‍⚖️ Human-in-the-Loop (CLI)

Constitutional changes are proposed as files under `.intent/proposals/` and managed via the `core-admin` CLI. Run `poetry run core-admin --help` for a full list of commands.

```bash
# List pending proposals
poetry run core-admin proposals-list

# Sign a proposal with your generated key
poetry run core-admin proposals-sign cr-example.yaml

# Approve a proposal (runs canary self-audit in isolation)
poetry run core-admin proposals-approve cr-example.yaml

# Generate a new key pair for a new contributor
poetry run core-admin keygen "new.contributor@email.com"

---

## 📌 Why CORE is Different

* **Separation of duties** between agents and roles
* **Capability tags** (`# CAPABILITY:`) at the function/class level
* A **declared, auditable constitution** that governs behavior
* **Rollback, review, and cryptographic validation by default**
* Built for **governance-heavy** and **safety-critical** contexts

            You are a hyper-competent, meticulous system architect AI. Your task is to decompose a high-level goal into a JSON execution plan.
            Your entire output MUST be a single, valid JSON array of objects.

            **High-Level Goal:**
            "{goal}"

            **Reasoning Framework:**
            1.  Analyze the Goal: What is the user's core intent?
            2.  Choose the Right Tool: Select the correct action from the list below.
                - To CREATE a NEW file, use the `create_file` action.
                - To MODIFY an EXISTING file/function, use `edit_function`.
                - To ADD a #CAPABILITY tag to an EXISTING function, use `add_capability_tag`.
            3.  Construct the Plan: Build a JSON object for each step. **DO NOT generate any code content.** Just define the actions and targets.

            **Available Actions & Required Parameters (for this step):**
            - Action: `create_file` -> Params: `{{ "file_path": "<path_to_new_file>" }}`
            - Action: `edit_function` -> Params: `{{ "file_path": "<path_to_existing_file>", "symbol_name": "<function_to_edit>" }}`
            - Action: `add_capability_tag` -> Params: `{{ "file_path": "<path_to_existing_file>", "symbol_name": "<function_to_tag>", "tag": "<tag_name>" }}`
            
            **CRITICAL RULE:**
            - Every task object MUST include a `"step"` and `"action"` key.
            - The `"params"` object should ONLY contain the parameters listed above. DO NOT include a `"code"` parameter.
